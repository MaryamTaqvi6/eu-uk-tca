A Party may require, under conditions set out in its laws or regulations, that the use of an accounting segregation method is subject to prior authorisation by the customs authorities of that Party. The customs authorities of the Party shall monitor the use of such authorisations and may withdraw an authorisation if the holder makes improper use of the accounting segregation method or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Chapter.

Article ORIG.16: Non-alteration 1. An originating product declared for home use in the importing Party shall not, after exportation and prior to being declared for home use, have been altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations other than to preserve it in good condition or than adding or affixing marks, labels, seals or any other documentation to ensure compliance with specific domestic requirements of the importing Party. 2.

Article ORIG.18a: Time of the claim for preferential tariff treatment 1. A claim for preferential tariff treatment and the basis for that claim as referred to in Article ORIG.18(2) [Claim for preferential tariff treatment] shall be included in the customs import declaration in accordance with the laws and regulations of the importing Party. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, if the importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation, the importing Party shall grant preferential tariff treatment and repay or remit any excess customs duty paid provided that: (a) the claim for preferential tariff treatment is made no later than three years after the date of importation, or such longer time period as specified in the laws and regulations of the importing Party; the importer provides the basis for the claim as referred to in Article ORIG.18(2) [Claim for preferential tariff treatment]; and the product would have been considered originating and would have satisfied all other applicable requirements within the meaning of Section 1 [Rules of origin] of this Chapter if it had been claimed by the importer at the time of importation.

2. A statement on origin shall be made out using one of the language versions set out in ANNEX ORIG-4 [Text of the statement on origin] in an invoice or on any other document that describes the originating product in sufficient detail to enable the identification of that product.

A statement on origin shall be valid for 12 months from the date it was made out or for such longer period as provided by the Party of import up to a maximum of 24 months. 4. (a) (b) A statement on origin may apply to: a single shipment of one or more products imported into a Party; or multiple shipments of identical products imported into a Party within the period specified in the statement on origin, which shall not exceed 12 months.

5. If, at the request of the importer, unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) for the Interpretation of the Harmonised System that fall within Sections XV to XXI of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single statement on origin for such products may be used in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party. Article ORIG.20: Discrepancies The customs authority of the importing Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment due to minor errors or discrepancies in the statement on origin, or for the sole reason that an invoice was issued in a third country. Article ORIG.21: Importer's knowledge 1. For the purposes of a claim for preferential tariff treatment that is made under point (b) of Article ORIG.18(2) [Claim for preferential tariff treatment], the importer's knowledge that a product is originating in the exporting Party shall be based on information demonstrating that the product is originating and satisfies the requirements provided for in this Chapter. 2. Before claiming the preferential treatment, in the event that an importer is unable to obtain the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article as a result of the exporter deeming it to be confidential information or for any other reason, the exporter may provide a statement on origin so that the importer may claim the preferential tariff treatment on the basis of point (a) of Article ORIG.18(2) [Claim for Preferential Tariff Treatment]. Article ORIG.22: Record-keeping requirements 1. For a minimum of three years after the date of importation of the product, an importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment for a product imported into the importing Party shall keep: (a) if the claim was based on a statement on origin, the statement on origin made out by the exporter; or if the claim was based on the importer's knowledge, all records demonstrating that the product satisfies the requirements for obtaining originating status. 35

The amounts to be used in a given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The exchange rate amounts shall be those published for that day by the European Central Bank, unless a different amount is communicated to the European Commission by 15 October, and shall apply from 1 January the following year.

If the customs authority of the importing Party has sufficient justification to deny preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1 of this Article, in cases where the customs authority of the exporting Party has provided an opinion pursuant to point (b) of Article ORIG.25(4) [Administrative cooperation] confirming the originating status of the products, the customs authority of the importing Party shall notify the customs authority of the exporting Party of its intention to deny the preferential tariff treatment within two months after the date of receipt of that opinion. If such notification is made, consultations shall be held at the request of either Party, within three months after the date of the notification. The period for consultation may be extended on a case-bycase basis by mutual agreement between the customs authorities of the Parties. The consultation may take place in accordance with the procedure set by the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin. Upon the expiry of the period for consultation, if the customs authority of the importing Party cannot confirm that the product is originating, it may deny the preferential tariff treatment if it has a sufficient justification for doing so and after having granted the importer the right to be heard. However, when the customs authority of the exporting Party confirms the originating status of the products and provides justification for such conclusion, the customs authority of the importing Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a product on the sole ground that Article ORIG.25(5) [Administrative cooperation] has been applied. 4.

(b)

"protected zone" for a specified regulated plant pest means an officially defined geographical area in which that pest is not established in spite of favourable conditions and its presence in other parts of the territory of the Party, and into which that pest is not allowed to be introduced.

3. The Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures may adopt other definitions for the purposes of this Chapter, taking into consideration the glossaries and definitions of the relevant international organisations, such as the Codex, OIE and IPPC. 4. The definitions under the SPS Agreement prevail to the extent that there is an inconsistency between the definitions adopted by the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures or adopted under the auspices of the Codex, the OIE, the IPPC and the definitions under the SPS Agreement. In the event of an inconsistency between definitions adopted by the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the definitions set out in the Codex, OIE or IPPC, the definitions set out in the Codex, OIE or IPPC shall prevail. Article SPS.4: Rights and obligations The Parties reaffirm their rights and obligations under the SPS Agreement. This includes the right to adopt measures in accordance with Article 5(7) of the SPS Agreement. Article SPS.5: General principles 1. The Parties shall apply SPS measures for achieving their appropriate level of protection that are based on risk assessments in accordance with relevant provisions, including Article 5 of the SPS Agreement. 2. The Parties shall not use SPS measures to create unjustified barriers to trade.

3. Regarding trade-related SPS procedures and approvals established under this Chapter, each Party shall ensure that these procedures and related SPS measures: (a) (b) are initiated and completed without undue delay; do not include unnecessary, scientifically and technically unjustified or unduly burdensome information requests that might delay access to each other's markets; are not applied in a manner which would constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other Party's entire territory or parts of the other Party's territory where identical or similar SPS conditions exist; and are proportionate to the risks identified and not more trade restrictive than necessary to achieve the importing Party's appropriate level of protection.

(c)

(d)

4. The Parties shall not use the procedures referred to in paragraph 3, or any requests for additional information, to delay access to their markets without scientific and technical justification. 5. Each Party shall ensure that any administrative procedure it requires concerning the import conditions on food safety, animal health or plant health is not more burdensome or trade restrictive than necessary to give the importing Party adequate confidence that these conditions are met. Each Party shall ensure that the negative effects on trade of any administrative procedures are kept to a minimum and that the clearance processes remain simple and expeditious while meeting the importing Party's conditions. 43

Where the importing Party requires official certificates, the model certificates shall be: (a) set in line with the principles as laid down in the international standards of the Codex, the IPPC and the OIE; and (b) applicable to imports from all parts of the territory of the exporting Party. 2. The Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures may agree on specific cases where the model certificates referred to in paragraph 1 would be established only for a part or parts of the territory of the exporting Party. The Parties shall promote the implementation of electronic certification and other technologies to facilitate trade. Article SPS.7: Import conditions and procedures 1. Without prejudice to the rights and obligations each Party has under the SPS Agreement and this Chapter, the import conditions of the importing Party shall apply to the entire territory of the exporting Party in a consistent manner. 2. The exporting Party shall ensure that products exported to the other Party, such as animals and animal products, plants and plant products, or other related objects, meet the SPS requirements of the importing Party. 3. The importing Party may require that imports of particular products are subject to authorisation. Such authorisation shall be granted where a request is made by the relevant competent authority of the exporting Party which objectively demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the importing Party, that the authorisation requirements of the importing Party are fulfilled. The relevant competent authority of the exporting Party may make a request for authorisation in respect of the entire territory of the exporting Party. The importing Party shall grant such requests on that basis, where they fulfil the authorisation requirements of the importing Party as set out in this paragraph. 4. The importing Party shall not introduce authorisation requirements which are additional to those which apply at the end of the transition period, unless the application of such requirements to further products is justified to mitigate a significant risk to human, animal or plant health. 5. The importing Party shall establish and communicate to the other Party import conditions for all products. The importing Party shall ensure that its import conditions are applied in a proportionate and non-discriminatory manner. 6. Without prejudice to provisional measures under Article 5(7) of the SPS Agreement, for products, or other related objects, where a phytosanitary concern exists, the import conditions shall be restricted to measures to protect against regulated pests of the importing Party and shall be applicable to the entire territory of the exporting Party. 7. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 3, in the case of import authorisation requests for a specific product, where the exporting Party has requested to be examined only for a part, or certain parts, of its territory (in the case of the Union, individual Member States), the importing Party shall promptly proceed to the examination of that request. Where the importing Party receives requests in respect of the specific product from more than one part of the exporting Party, or, where further requests are 44

received in respect of a product which has already been authorised, the importing Party shall expedite completion of the authorisation procedure, taking into account the identical or similar SPS regime applicable in the different parts of the exporting Party. 8. Each Party shall ensure that all SPS control, inspection and approval procedures are initiated and completed without undue delay. Information requirements shall be limited to what is necessary for the approval process to take into account information already available in the importing Party, such as on the legislative framework and audit reports of the exporting Party. 9. Except in duly justified circumstances related to its level of protection, each Party shall provide a transition period between the publication of any changes to its approval procedures and their application to allow the other Party to become familiar with and adapt to such changes. Each Party shall not unduly prolong the approval process for applications submitted prior to publication of the changes. 10. (a) In relation to the processes set out in paragraphs 3 to 8, the following actions shall be taken: as soon as the importing Party has positively concluded its assessment, it shall promptly take all necessary legislative and administrative measures to allow trade to take place without undue delay; the exporting Party shall: (i) (ii) (c) provide all relevant information required by the importing Party; and give reasonable access to the importing Party for audit and other relevant procedures.

(b)

the importing party shall establish a list of regulated pests for products, or other related objects, where a phytosanitary concern exists. That list shall contain: (i) (ii) (iii) the pests not known to occur within any part of its own territory; the pests known to occur within its own territory and under official control; the pests known to occur within parts of its own territory and for which pest free areas or protected zones are established; and non-quarantine pests known to occur within its own territory and under official control for specified planting material.

(iv)

11. The importing Party shall accept consignments without requiring that the importing Party verifies compliance of those consignments before their departure from the territory of the exporting Party. 12. A Party may collect fees for the costs incurred to conduct specific SPS frontier checks, which should not exceed the recovery of the costs. 13. The importing Party shall have the right to carry out import checks on products imported from the exporting Party for the purposes of ensuring compliance with its SPS import requirements. 14. The import checks carried out on products imported from the exporting Party shall be based on the SPS risk associated with such importations. Import checks shall be carried out only to the extent 45

necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health, without undue delay and with a minimum effect on trade between the Parties. 15. Information on the proportion of products from the exporting Party checked at import shall be made available by the importing Party upon request of the exporting Party. 16. If import checks reveal non-compliance with the relevant import conditions the action taken by the importing Party must be based on an assessment of the risk involved and not be more trade restrictive than required to achieve the Party's appropriate level of SPS protection. Article SPS.8 Lists of approved establishments 1. Whenever justified, the importing Party may maintain a list of approved establishments meeting its import requirements as a condition to allow imports of animal products from these establishments. 2. Unless justified to mitigate a significant risk to human or animal health, lists of approved establishments shall only be required for the products for which they were required at the end of the transition period. 3. The exporting Party shall inform the importing Party of its list of establishments meeting the importing Party's conditions which shall be based on guarantees provided by the exporting Party. 4. Upon a request from the exporting Party, the importing Party shall approve establishments which are situated in the territory of the exporting Party, based on guarantees provided by the exporting Party, without prior inspection of individual establishments. 5. Unless the importing Party requests additional information and subject to guarantees being provided by the exporting party, the importing Party shall take the necessary legislative or administrative measures, in accordance with its applicable legal procedures, to allow imports from those establishments without undue delay. 6. The list of the approved establishments shall be made publicly available by the importing Party. 7. Where the importing Party decides to reject the request of the exporting Party to accept adding an establishment to the list of approved establishments, it shall inform the exporting Party without delay and shall submit a reply, including information about the non-conformities which led to the rejection of the establishment's approval. Article SPS.9: Transparency and exchange of information 1. Each Party shall pursue transparency as regards SPS measures applicable to trade and shall for those purposes undertake the following actions: (a) promptly communicate to the other Party any changes to its SPS measures and approval procedures, including changes that may affect its capacity to fulfil the SPS import requirements of the other Party for certain products; (b) enhance mutual understanding of its SPS measures and their application;

(c) exchange information with the other Party on matters related to the development and application of SPS measures, including the progress on new available scientific evidence, that affect, or may affect, trade between the Parties with a view to minimising negative trade effects; (d) upon request of the other Party, communicate the conditions that apply for the import of specific products within 20 working days; (e) upon request of the other Party, communicate the state of play of the procedure for the authorisation of specific products within 20 working days; (f) communicate to the other Party any significant change to the structure or organisation of a Party's competent authority; (g) on request, communicate the results of a Party's official control and a report that concerns the results of the control carried out; (h) on request, communicate the results of an import check provided for in case of a rejected or a noncompliant consignment; and (i) on request, communicate, without undue delay, a risk assessment or scientific opinion produced by a Party that is relevant to this Chapter. 2. Where a Party has made available the information in paragraph 1 via notification to the WTO's Central Registry of Notifications or to the relevant international standard-setting body, in accordance with its relevant rules, the requirements in paragraph 1, as they apply to that information, are fulfilled. Article SPS.10: Adaptation to regional conditions 1. The Parties shall recognise the concept of zoning including disease or pest-free areas, protected zones and areas of low disease or pest prevalence and shall apply it to the trade between the Parties, in accordance with the SPS Agreement, including the guidelines to further the practical implementation of Article 6 of the SPS Agreement (WTO/SPS Committee Decision G/SPS/48) and the relevant recommendations, standards and guidelines of the OIE and IPPC. The Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures may define further details for these procedures, taking into account any relevant SPS Agreement, OIE and IPPC standards, guidelines or recommendations. 2. The Parties may also agree to cooperate on the concept of compartmentalisation as referred to in Chapters 4.4 and 4.5 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and Chapters 4.1 and 4.2 of the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code. 3. When establishing or maintaining the zones referred to in paragraph 1, the Parties shall consider factors such as geographical location, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance and the effectiveness of SPS controls. 4. With regard to animals and animal products, when establishing or maintaining import conditions upon the request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall recognise the diseasefree areas established by the exporting Party as a basis for consideration towards the determination of allowing or maintaining the import, without prejudice to paragraphs 8 and 9. 5. The exporting Party shall identify the parts of its territory referred to in paragraph 4 and, if requested, provide a full explanation and supporting data based on the OIE standards, or in other ways 47

established by the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, based on the knowledge acquired through experience of the exporting Party's relevant authorities. 6. With regard to plants, plant products, and other related objects, when establishing or maintaining phytosanitary import conditions, on request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall recognise the pest-free areas, pest-free places of production, pest-free production sites, areas of low pest prevalence and protected zones established by the exporting Party as a basis for consideration towards the determination to allow or maintain the import, without prejudice to paragraphs 8 and 9. 7. The exporting Party shall identify its pest-free areas, pest-free places of production, pest-free production sites and areas of low pest prevalence or protected zones. If requested by the importing Party, the exporting Party shall provide a full explanation and supporting data based on the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures developed under the IPPC, or in other ways established by the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, based on the knowledge acquired through experience of the exporting Party's relevant phytosanitary authorities. 8. The Parties shall recognise disease-free areas and protected zones which are in place at the end of the transition period. 9. Paragraph 8 shall also apply to subsequent adaptations to the disease-free areas and protected zones (in the case of the United Kingdom pest-free areas), except in cases of significant changes in the disease or pest situations. 10. The Parties may carry out audits and verifications pursuant to Article 11 to implement paragraphs 4 to 9 of this Article. 11. The Parties shall establish close cooperation with the objective of maintaining confidence in the procedures in relation to the establishment of disease- or pest-free areas, pest-free places of production, pest-free production sites and areas of low pest or disease prevalence and protected zones, with the aim to minimise trade disruption. 12. The importing Party shall base its own determination of the animal or plant health status of the exporting Party or parts thereof on the information provided by the exporting Party in accordance with the SPS Agreement, OIE and IPPC standards, and take into consideration any determination made by the exporting Party. 13. Where the importing Party does not accept the determination made by the exporting Party as referred to in paragraph 12 of this Article, the importing Party shall objectively justify and explain to the exporting Party the reasons for that rejection and, upon request, hold consultations, in accordance with Article SPS 12(2). 14. Each Party shall ensure that the obligations set out in paragraphs 4 to 9, 12 and 13 are carried out without undue delay. The importing Party will expedite the recognition of the disease or pest status when the status has been recovered after an outbreak. 15. Where a Party considers that a specific region has a special status with respect to a specific disease and which fulfils the criteria laid down in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code Chapter 1.2 or the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code Chapter 1.2, it may request recognition of this status. The importing Party may request additional guarantees in respect of imports of live animals and animal products appropriate to the agreed status. 48

3. Each Party shall use relevant international standards as a basis for its technical regulations except when it can demonstrate that such international standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued. 4. International standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) shall be the relevant international standards within the meaning of Article 2, Article 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement. 5. A standard developed by other international organisations, could also be considered a relevant international standard within the meaning of Article 2, Article 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, provided that: (a) it has been developed by a standardising body which seeks to establish consensus either: (i) among national delegations of the participating WTO Members representing all the national standardising bodies in their territory that have adopted, or expect to adopt, standards for the subject matter to which the international standardisation activity relates, or, among governmental bodies of participating WTO Members, and,

(ii)

(b) it has been developed in accordance with the Decision of the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5, and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement.4 6. Where a Party does not use international standards as a basis for a technical regulation, on request of the other Party, it shall identify any substantial deviation from the relevant international standard, explain the reasons why such standards were judged inappropriate or ineffective for the objective pursued, and provide the scientific or technical evidence on which that assessment was based. 7. Each Party shall review its technical regulations to increase the convergence of those technical regulations with relevant international standards, taking into account, inter alia, any new developments in the relevant international standards or any changes in the circumstances that have given rise to divergence from any relevant international standards. 8. In accordance with its respective rules and procedures and without prejudice to Title X [Good Regulatory Practices and Regulatory Cooperation], when developing a major technical regulation which may have a significant effect on trade, each Party shall ensure that procedures exist that allow persons to express their opinion in a public consultation, except where urgent problems of safety, health, environment or national security arise or threaten to arise. Each Party shall allow persons of the other Party to participate in such consultations on terms that are no less favourable than those accorded to its own nationals, and shall make the results of those consultations public.

Article TBT.5: Standards 1. Each Party shall encourage the standardising bodies established within its territory, as well as the regional standardising bodies of which a Party or the standardising bodies established in its territory are members: (a) to participate, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation of international standards by relevant international standardising bodies; to use relevant international standards as a basis for the standards they develop, except where such international standards would be ineffective or inappropriate, for example because of an insufficient level of protection, fundamental climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems; to avoid duplications of, or overlaps with, the work of international standardising bodies; to review national and regional standards that are not based on relevant international standards at regular intervals, with a view to increasing the convergence of those standards with relevant international standards; to cooperate with the relevant standardising bodies of the other Party in international standardisation activities, including through cooperation in the international standardising bodies or at regional level; to foster bilateral cooperation with the standardising bodies of the other Party; and to exchange information between standardising bodies.

Where standards are rendered mandatory in a draft technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, through incorporation or reference, the transparency obligations set out in Article TBT.7 [Transparency] and in Articles 2 or 5 of the TBT Agreement shall apply. Article TBT.6: Conformity assessment 1. Article TBT.4 [Technical regulations] concerning the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations shall also apply to conformity assessment procedures, mutatis mutandis. 2. Where a Party requires conformity assessment as a positive assurance that a product conforms with a technical regulation, it shall: (a) select conformity assessment procedures that are proportionate to the risks involved, as determined on the basis of a risk-assessment; consider as proof of compliance with technical regulations the use of a supplier's declaration of conformity, i.e. a declaration of conformity issued by the manufacturer on the sole 55

responsibility of the manufacturer without a mandatory third-party assessment, as assurance of conformity among the options for showing compliance with technical regulations; (c) where requested by the other Party, provide information on the criteria used to select the conformity assessment procedures for specific products.

3. Where a Party requires third party conformity assessment as a positive assurance that a product conforms with a technical regulation and it has not reserved this task to a government authority as specified in paragraph 4, it shall: (a) use accreditation, as appropriate, as a means to demonstrate technical competence to qualify conformity assessment bodies. Without prejudice to its right to establish requirements for conformity assessment bodies, each Party recognises the valuable role that accreditation operated with authority derived from government and on a non-commercial basis can play in the qualification of conformity assessment bodies; use relevant international standards for accreditation and conformity assessment; encourage accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies located within its territory to join any relevant functioning international agreements or arrangements for harmonisation or facilitation of acceptance of conformity assessment results; if two or more conformity assessment bodies are authorised by a Party to carry out conformity assessment procedures required for placing a product on the market, ensure that economic operators have a choice amongst the conformity assessment bodies designated by the authorities of a Party for a particular product or set of products; ensure that conformity assessment bodies are independent of manufacturers, importers and economic operators in general and that there are no conflicts of interest between accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies; allow conformity assessment bodies to use subcontractors to perform testing or inspections in relation to the conformity assessment, including subcontractors located in the territory of the other Party, and may require subcontractors to meet the same requirements the conformity assessment body must meet to perform such testing or inspections itself; and publish on a single website a list of the bodies that it has designated to perform such conformity assessment and the relevant information on the scope of designation of each such body.

6. Each Party shall publish and maintain a list of the product areas referred to in paragraph 5 for information purposes, together with the references to the applicable technical regulations. 7. Notwithstanding paragraph 5, either Party may introduce requirements for the mandatory third party testing or certification of the product areas referred to in that paragraph, provided that such requirements are justified on grounds of legitimate objectives and are proportionate to the purpose of giving the importing Party adequate confidence that products conform with the applicable technical regulations or standards, taking account of the risks that non-conformity would create. 8. A Party proposing to introduce the conformity assessment procedures referred to in paragraph 7 shall notify the other Party at an early stage and shall take the comments of the other Party into account in devising any such conformity assessment procedures. Article TBT.7: Transparency 1. Except where urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise, each Party shall allow the other Party to provide written comments on notified proposed technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures within a period of at least 60 days from the date of the transmission of the notification of such regulations or procedures to the WTO Central Registry of Notifications. A Party shall give positive consideration to a reasonable request to extend that comment period. 2. Each Party shall provide the electronic version of the full notified text together with the notification. In the event that the notified text is not in one of the official WTO languages, the notifying Party shall provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the content of the measure in the WTO notification format. 3. If a Party receives written comments on its proposed technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure from the other Party, it shall: (a) if requested by the other Party, discuss the written comments with the participation of its competent regulatory authority, at a time when they can be taken into account; and reply in writing to the comments no later than the date of publication of the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure.

(b)

4. Each Party shall endeavour to publish on a website its responses to the comments it receives following the notification referred to in paragraph 1 no later than on the date of publication of the adopted technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure. 5. Each Party shall, where requested by the other Party, provide information regarding the objectives of, legal basis for and rationale for, any technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure that the Party has adopted or is proposing to adopt. 6. Each Party shall ensure that the technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures it has adopted are published on a website that is accessible free of charge. 7.

A Party shall give positive consideration to a reasonable request from the other Party received prior to the end of the comment period set out in paragraph 1 to extend the period of time between the adoption of the technical regulation and its entry into force, except where the delay would be ineffective in fulfilling the legitimate objectives pursued. 10. Each Party shall ensure that the enquiry point established in accordance with Article 10 of the TBT Agreement provides information and answers in one of the official WTO languages to reasonable enquiries from the other Party or from interested persons of the other Party regarding adopted technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures. Article TBT.8: Marking and labelling 1. The technical regulations of a Party may include or exclusively address mandatory marking or labelling requirements. In such cases, the principles of Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement apply to these technical regulations. 2. Where a Party requires mandatory marking or labelling of products, all of the following conditions shall apply: (a) it shall only require information which is relevant for consumers or users of the product or information that indicates that the product conforms to the mandatory technical requirements; it shall not require any prior approval, registration or certification of the labels or markings of products, nor any fee disbursement, as a precondition for placing on its market products that otherwise comply with its mandatory technical requirements unless it is necessary in view of legitimate objectives; where the Party requires the use of a unique identification number by economic operators, it shall issue such a number to the economic operators of the other Party without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis; unless the information listed in points (i), (ii) or (iii) would be misleading, contradictory or confusing in relation to the information that the importing Party requires with respect to the goods, the importing Party shall permit: (i) information in other languages in addition to the language required in the importing Party of the goods; internationally-accepted nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or graphics; and additional information to that required in the importing Party of the goods;

unless it considers that legitimate objectives may be undermined, it shall endeavour to accept the use of non-permanent or detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation, rather than requiring labels or marking to be physically attached to the product. Article TBT.9: Cooperation on market surveillance and non-food product safety and compliance

1. The Parties recognise the importance of cooperation on market surveillance, compliance and the safety of non-food products for the facilitation of trade and for the protection of consumers and other users, and the importance of building mutual trust based on shared information. 2. To guarantee the independent and impartial functioning of market surveillance, the Parties shall ensure: (a) (b) the separation of market surveillance functions from conformity assessment functions; and the absence of any interests that would affect the impartiality of market surveillance authorities in the performance of their control or supervision of economic operators.

3. The Parties shall cooperate and exchange information in the area of non-food product safety and compliance, which may include in particular the following: (a) (b) (c) (d) market surveillance and enforcement activities and measures; risk assessment methods and product testing; coordinated product recalls or other similar actions; scientific, technical and regulatory matters in order to improve non-food product safety and compliance; emerging issues of significant health and safety relevance; standardisation-related activities; exchanges of officials.

The Partnership Council shall have the power to adopt decisions in order to determine or amend the arrangements set out in Annexes TBT-XX and TBT-ZZ. 9. For the purposes of this Article, `market surveillance' means activities conducted and measures taken by market surveillance and enforcement authorities, including activities conducted and measures taken in cooperation with economic operators, on the basis of procedures of a Party to enable that Party to monitor or address safety of products and their compliance with the requirements set out in its laws and regulations. 10. Each Party shall ensure that any measure taken by its market surveillance or enforcement authorities to withdraw or recall from its market or to prohibit or restrict the making available on its market of a product imported from the territory of the other Party, for reasons related to noncompliance with the applicable legislation, is proportionate, states the exact grounds on which the measure is based and is communicated without delay to the relevant economic operator. Article TBT.10: Technical discussions 1. If a Party considers that a draft or proposed technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure of the other Party might have a significant effect on trade between the Parties, it may request technical discussions on the matter. The request shall be made in writing to the other Party and shall identify: (a) (b) (c) the measure at issue; the provisions of this Chapter or of an Annex to this Chapter to which the concerns relate; and the reasons for the request, including a description of the requesting Party's concerns regarding the measure.

Article SERVIN.2.4: Most favoured nation treatment 1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party and to covered enterprises treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to investors of a third country and to their enterprises, with respect to establishment in its territory. 2. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party and to covered enterprises treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to investors of a third country and to their enterprises, with respect to operation in its territory. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be construed as obliging a Party to extend to investors of the other Party or to covered enterprises the benefit of any treatment resulting from: (a) an international agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or other international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation; or measures providing for recognition, including the recognition of the standards or criteria for the authorisation, licencing, or certification of a natural person or enterprise to carry out an economic activity, or the recognition of prudential measures as referred to in paragraph 3 of the GATS Annex on Financial Services.

(b)

4. For greater certainty, the "treatment" referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 does not include investor-to-state dispute settlement procedures provided for in other international agreements. 5. For greater certainty, the existence of substantive provisions in other international agreements concluded by a Party with a third country, or the mere formal transposition of those provisions into domestic law to the extent that it is necessary in order to incorporate them into the domestic legal order, do not in themselves constitute the "treatment" referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. Measures of a Party pursuant to those provisions may constitute such treatment and thus give rise to a breach of this Article. Article SERVIN.2.5: Senior management and boards of directors A Party shall not require a covered enterprise to appoint individuals of any particular nationality as executives, managers or members of boards of directors. Article SERVIN.2.6: Performance requirements 1. A Party shall not impose or enforce any requirement, or enforce any commitment or undertaking, in connection with the establishment or operation of any enterprise in its territory: (a) (b) (c) to export a given level or percentage of goods or services; to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content; to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced or services provided in its territory or to purchase goods or services from natural or legal persons or any other entities in its territory; to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with such enterprise; 80

to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that such enterprise produces or supplies, by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange inflows; to transfer technology, a production process or other proprietary knowledge to a natural or legal person or any other entity in its territory12; to supply exclusively from the territory of that Party a good produced or a service supplied by the enterprise to a specific regional or world market; to locate the headquarters for a specific region of the World which is broader than the territory of the Party or the world market in its territory; to employ a given number or percentage of natural persons of that Party; to achieve a given level or value of research and development in its territory; to restrict the exportation or sale for export; or with regard to any licence contract in existence at the time the requirement is imposed or enforced, or any commitment or undertaking is enforced, or with regard to any future licence contract freely entered into between the enterprise and a natural or legal person or any other entity in its territory, if the requirement is imposed or enforced or the commitment or undertaking is enforced, in a manner that constitutes direct interference with that licence contract by an exercise of non-judicial governmental authority of a Party, to adopt: (i) (ii) a rate or amount of royalty below a certain level; or a given duration of the term of a licence contract.

(f)

(i) (j) (k) (l)

This point does not apply where the licence contract is concluded between the enterprise and the Party. For the purposes of this point, a "licence contract" means any contract concerning the licensing of technology, a production process, or other proprietary knowledge. 2. A Party shall not condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment or operation of an enterprise in its territory, on compliance with any of the following requirements: (a) (b) achieving a given level or percentage of domestic content; purchasing, using or according a preference to goods produced or services supplied in its territory, or to purchase goods or services from natural or legal persons or any other entity in its territory; relating in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with that enterprise;

restricting the sales of goods or services in its territory that that enterprise produces or supplies by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange inflows; or restricting the exportation or sale for export.

(e)

3. Paragraph 2 shall not be construed as preventing a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment or operation of any enterprise in its territory, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, supply a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory. 4. (a) Points (f) and (l) of paragraph 1 do not apply where: the requirement is imposed or enforced, or the commitment or undertaking is enforced, by a court or administrative tribunal, or by a competition authority pursuant to a Party's competition law to prevent or remedy a restriction or a distortion of competition; or a Party authorises the use of an intellectual property right in accordance with Article 31 or Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement, or adopts or maintains measures requiring the disclosure of data or proprietary information that fall within the scope of, and are consistent with, paragraph 3 of Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement.

(b)

5. Points (a) to (c) of paragraph 1 and points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 do not apply to qualification requirements for goods or services with respect to participation in export promotion and foreign aid programmes. 6. For greater certainty, this Article does not preclude the enforcement by the competent authorities of a Party of any commitment or undertaking given between persons other than a Party which was not directly or indirectly imposed or required by that Party. 7. For greater certainty, points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 do not apply to requirements imposed by an importing Party in relation to the content of goods necessary to qualify for preferential tariffs or preferential quotas. 8. Point (l) of paragraph 1 does not apply if the requirement is imposed or enforced, or the commitment or undertaking is enforced, by a tribunal as equitable remuneration under the Party's copyright laws. 9. A Party shall neither impose nor enforce any measure inconsistent with its obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs), even where such measure has been listed by that Party in ANNEX SERVIN-1 [Existing measures] or ANNEX SERVIN-2 [Future measures]. 10. For greater certainty, this Article shall not be construed as requiring a Party to permit a particular service to be supplied on a cross-border basis where that Party adopts or maintains restrictions or prohibitions on such provision of services which are consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in ANNEX SERVIN-1 [Existing measures] or ANNEX SERVIN-2 [Future measures]. 11. A condition for the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage referred to in paragraph 2 does not constitute a requirement or a commitment or undertaking for the purposes of paragraph 1. 82

2. Articles SERVIN.2.2 [Market access], SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment], SERVIN.2.4 [Most favoured nation treatment], SERVIN.2.5 [Senior management and boards of directors] and SERVIN.2.6 [Performance requirements] do not apply to a measure of a Party which is consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in Annex SERVIN.2 [Future measures]. 3. Articles SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment] and SERVIN.2.4 [Most favoured nation treatment] do not apply to any measure that constitutes an exception to, or a derogation from, Articles 3 or 4 of the TRIPS Agreement, as specifically provided for in Articles 3 to 5 of that Agreement. 83

4. For greater certainty, Articles SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment] and SERVIN.2.4 [Most favoured nation treatment] shall not be construed as preventing a Party from prescribing information requirements, including for statistical purposes, in connection with the establishment or operation of investors of the other Party or of covered enterprises, provided that it does not constitute a means to circumvent that Party's obligations under those Articles. Chapter 3: Cross-border trade in services Article SERVIN.3.1: Scope This Chapter applies to measures of a Party affecting the cross-border trade in services by service suppliers of the other Party. Article SERVIN.3.2: Market access A Party shall not adopt or maintain, either on the basis of its entire territory or on the basis of a territorial sub-division, measures that: (a) impose limitations on: (i) the number of services suppliers that may supply a specific service, whether in the form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the requirement of an economic needs test; the total value of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; or the total number of service operations or on the total quantity of service output expressed in the terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test13; or

(ii)

(iii)

(b) restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a service supplier may supply a service.

13

3. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of the Party compared to services or service suppliers of the other Party. 4. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring either Party to compensate for inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or services suppliers. Article SERVIN.3.5: Most favoured nation treatment 1. Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to services and service suppliers of a third country. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not be construed as obliging a Party to extend to services and service suppliers of the other Party the benefit of any treatment resulting from: (a) an international agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or other international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation; or measures providing for recognition, including of the standards or criteria for the authorisation, licencing, or certification of a natural person or enterprise to carry out an economic activity, or of prudential measures as referred to in paragraph 3 of the GATS Annex on Financial Services.

(b)

3. For greater certainty, the existence of substantive provisions in other international agreements concluded by a Party with a third country, or mere formal transposition of those provisions into domestic law to the extent that it is necessary in order to incorporate them into the domestic legal order, do not in themselves constitute the "treatment" referred to in paragraph 1. Measures of a Party pursuant to those provisions may constitute such treatment and thus give rise to a breach of this Article. Article SERVIN.3.6: Non-conforming measures 1. Articles SERVIN.3.2 [Market access], SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence], SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment] and SERVIN.3.5 [Most favoured nation treatment] do not apply to: any existing non-conforming measure of a Party at the level of: (i) for the Union: (A) the Union, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex SERVIN-1 [Existing measures]; (B) the central government of a Member State, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex SERVIN-1 [Existing measures]; a regional government of a Member State, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex SERVIN-1 [Existing measures]; or a local government, other than that referred to in point (C); and

Articles 3.2 [Market access], SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence], SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment] and SERVIN.3.5 [Most favoured nation treatment] do not apply to any measure of a Party which is consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in Annex SERVIN-2 [Future measures].

The recipient enterprise may be required to submit a training programme covering the duration of the stay for prior approval, demonstrating that the purpose of the stay is for training.

This Section does not apply to licensing requirements and procedures, qualification requirements and procedures, formalities and technical standards pursuant to a measure: (a) that does not conform with Article SERVIN.2.2 [Market access] or 2.3 [National treatment] and is referred to in points (a) to (c) of Article SERVIN.2.7(1) [Non-conforming measures and exceptions] or with Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access], Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence] or Article SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment] and is referred to in points (a) to (c) of Article SERVIN.3.6(1) [Non-conforming measures] or with points (b) and (c) of Article SERVIN 4.2(1) [Intra-corporate transferees and business visitors for establishment purposes], or Article SERVIN 4.3(3) [Short-term business visitors]] or with points (b) and (c) of Article SERVIN 4.4(1) [Contractual service suppliers and independent professionals] and is referred to in Article SERVIN 4.5(1) [Non-conforming measures]; or referred to in Article SERVIN.2.7(2) [Non-conforming measures and exceptions] or Article SERVIN.3.6(2) [Non-conforming measures]. For the purposes of this Section: "authorisation" means the permission to carry out any of the activities referred to in points (a) to (c) of paragraph 1 resulting from a procedure a natural or legal person must adhere to in order to demonstrate compliance with licensing requirements, qualification requirements, 92

technical standards or formalities for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining or renewing that permission; and (b) "competent authority" means a central, regional or local government or authority or nongovernmental body in the exercise of powers delegated by central, regional or local governments or authorities, which is entitled to take a decision concerning the authorisation referred to in point (a). Article SERVIN.5.2: Submission of applications Each Party shall, to the extent practicable, avoid requiring an applicant to approach more than one competent authority for each application for authorisation. If an activity for which authorisation is requested is within the jurisdiction of multiple competent authorities, multiple applications for authorisation may be required. Article SERVIN.5.3: Application timeframes If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities, to the extent practicable, permit the submission of an application at any time throughout the year. If a specific time period for applying for authorisation exists, the Party shall ensure that the competent authorities allow a reasonable period of time for the submission of an application. Article SERVIN.5.4: Electronic applications and acceptance of copies If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities: (a) to the extent possible provide for applications to be completed by electronic means, including from within the territory of the other Party; and accept copies of documents, that are authenticated in accordance with the Party's domestic law, in place of original documents, unless the competent authorities require original documents to protect the integrity of the authorisation process. Article SERVIN.5.5: Processing of applications 1. (a) If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities: process applications throughout the year. Where that is not possible, this information should be made public in advance, to the extent feasible; to the extent practicable, provide an indicative timeframe for the processing of an application. That timeframe shall be reasonable to the extent practicable; at the request of the applicant, provide without undue delay information concerning the status of the application; to the extent practicable, ascertain without undue delay the completeness of an application for processing under the Party's domestic laws and regulations;

(e)

if they consider an application complete for the purposes of processing under the Party's domestic laws and regulations,19 within a reasonable period of time after the submission of the application ensure that: (i) (ii) the processing of the application is completed; and the applicant is informed of the decision concerning the application, to the extent possible, in writing;20

(f)

if they consider an application incomplete for the purposes of processing under the Party's domestic laws and regulations, within a reasonable period of time, to the extent practicable: (i) (ii) inform the applicant that the application is incomplete; at the request of the applicant identify the additional information required to complete the application or otherwise provide guidance on why the application is considered incomplete; and provide the applicant with the opportunity to provide the additional information that is required to complete the application;21

(iii)

however, if none of the above is practicable, and the application is rejected due to incompleteness, competent authorities shall ensure that they inform the applicant within a reasonable period of time; and (g) if an application is rejected, either upon their own initiative or upon request of the applicant, inform the applicant of the reasons for rejection and of the timeframe for an appeal against that decision and, if applicable, the procedures for resubmission of an application; an applicant shall not be prevented from submitting another application solely on the basis of a previously rejected application.

2. The Parties shall ensure that their competent authorities grant an authorisation as soon as it is established, on the basis of an appropriate examination, that the applicant meets the conditions for obtaining it. 3. The Parties shall ensure that, once granted, an authorisation enters into effect without undue delay, subject to the applicable terms and conditions.22

19

Balancing resource constraints against the potential burden on businesses, in cases where it is reasonable to do so, competent authorities may require that all information is submitted in a specified format to consider it "complete for the purposes of processing". Competent authorities may meet the requirement set out in point (ii) by informing an applicant in advance in writing, including through a published measure, that a lack of response after a specified period of time from the date of submission of the application indicates acceptance of the application. The reference to "in writing" should be understood as including electronic format. Such "opportunity" does not require a competent authority to provide extensions of deadlines. Competent authorities are not responsible for delays due to reasons outside their competence.

Article SERVIN.5.6: Fees 1. For all economic activities other than financial services, each Party shall ensure that the authorisation fees charged by its competent authorities are reasonable and transparent and do not in themselves restrict the supply of the relevant service or the pursuit of any other economic activity. Having regard to the cost and administrative burden, each Party is encouraged to accept payment of authorisation fees by electronic means. 2. With regard to financial services, each Party shall ensure that its competent authorities, with respect to authorisation fees that they charge, provide applicants with a schedule of fees or information on how fee amounts are determined, and do not use the fees as a means of avoiding the Party's commitments or obligations. 3. Authorisation fees do not include fees for the use of natural resources, payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions or mandated contributions to universal service provision. Article SERVIN.5.7: Assessment of qualifications If a Party requires an examination to assess the qualifications of an applicant for authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities schedule such an examination at reasonably frequent intervals and provide a reasonable period of time to enable applicants to request to take the examination. To the extent practicable, each Party shall accept requests in electronic format to take such examinations and shall consider the use of electronic means in other aspects of examination processes. Article SERVIN.5.8: Publication and information available 1. If a Party requires authorisation, the Party shall promptly publish the information necessary for persons carrying out or seeking to carry out the activities referred to in Article SERVIN.5.1(1) [Scope and definitions] for which the authorisation is required to comply with the requirements, formalities, technical standards and procedures for obtaining, maintaining, amending and renewing such authorisation. Such information shall include, to the extent it exists: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) the licensing and qualification requirements and procedures and formalities; contact information of relevant competent authorities; authorisation fees; applicable technical standards; procedures for appeal or review of decisions concerning applications; procedures for monitoring or enforcing compliance with the terms and conditions of licences or qualifications; opportunities for public involvement, such as through hearings or comments; and indicative timeframes for the processing of an application.

portal or otherwise ensure that competent authorities make them easily accessible through alternative electronic means. 2. Each Party shall require each of its competent authorities to respond to any request for information or assistance, to the extent practicable. Article SERVIN.5.9: Technical standards Each Party shall encourage its competent authorities, when adopting technical standards, to adopt technical standards developed through open and transparent processes, and shall encourage any body, including relevant international organisations, designated to develop technical standards to do so through open and transparent processes. Article SERVIN.5.10: Conditions for authorisation 1. Each Party shall ensure that measures relating to authorisation are based on criteria which preclude the competent authorities from exercising their power of assessment in an arbitrary manner and may include, inter alia, competence and the ability to supply a service or any other economic activity, including to do so in compliance with a Party's regulatory requirements such as health and environmental requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand that in reaching decisions a competent authority may balance criteria. 2. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) 3. (a) The criteria referred to in paragraph 1 shall be: clear and unambiguous; objective and transparent; pre-established; made public in advance; impartial; and easily accessible. If a Party adopts or maintains a measure relating to authorisation, it shall ensure that: the competent authority concerned processes applications, and reaches and administers its decisions objectively and impartially and in a manner independent of the undue influence of any person carrying out the economic activity for which authorisation is required; and the procedures themselves do not prevent fulfilment of the requirements. Article SERVIN.5.11: Limited numbers of licences If the number of licences available for a given activity is limited because of the scarcity of available natural resources or technical capacity, a Party shall apply a selection procedure to potential candidates which provides full guarantees of impartiality, objectivity and transparency, including, in particular, adequate publicity about the launch, conduct and completion of the procedure. In establishing the rules for the selection procedure, a Party may take into account legitimate policy

objectives, including considerations of health, safety, the protection of the environment and the preservation of cultural heritage. Section 2: Provisions of general application Article SERVIN.5.12: Review procedures for administrative decisions A Party shall maintain judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, on request of an affected investor or service supplier of the other Party, for the prompt review of, and if justified appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions that affect establishment or operation, cross-border trade in services or the supply of a service through the presence of a natural person of a Party in the territory of the other Party. For the purposes of this Section, "administrative decisions" means a decision or action with a legal effect that applies to a specific person, good or service in an individual case and covers the failure to take an administrative decision or take such action when that is so required by a Party's law. If such procedures are not independent of the competent authority entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, a Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review. Article SERVIN.5.13: Professional qualifications 1. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Party from requiring that natural persons possess the necessary professional qualifications specified in the territory where the activity is performed, for the sector of activity concerned23. 2. The professional bodies or authorities, which are relevant for the sector of activity concerned in their respective territories, may develop and provide joint recommendations on the recognition of professional qualifications to the Partnership Council. Such joint recommendations shall be supported by an evidence-based assessment of: (a) the economic value of an envisaged arrangement on the recognition of professional qualifications; and the compatibility of the respective regimes, that is, the extent to which the requirements applied by each Party for the authorisation, licensing, operation and certification are compatible.

(b)

3. On receipt of a joint recommendation, the Partnership Council shall review its consistency with this Title within a reasonable period of time. The Partnership Council may, following such review, develop and adopt an arrangement on the conditions for the recognition of professional qualifications by decision as an annex to this Agreement, which shall be considered to form an integral part of this Title.24

23

For greater certainty, this Article shall not be construed to prevent the negotiation and conclusion of one or more agreements between the Parties on the recognition of professional qualifications on conditions and requirements different from those provided for in this Article. For greater certainty, such arrangements shall not lead to the automatic recognition of qualifications but shall set, in the mutual interest of both Parties, the conditions for the competent authorities granting recognition.

4. An arrangement referred to under paragraph 3 shall provide for the conditions for recognition of professional qualifications acquired in the Union and professional qualifications acquired in the United Kingdom relating to an activity covered by this Title and Title III [Digital Trade] of Heading One. 5. The Guidelines for arrangements on the recognition of professional qualifications set out in Annex SERVIN-6 [Guidelines for arrangements on the recognition of professional qualifications] shall be taken into account in the development of the joint recommendations referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article and by the Partnership Council when assessing whether to adopt such an Arrangement, as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.

Section 2: Trade marks Article IP.18: Trade mark classification Each Party shall maintain a trade mark classification system that is consistent with the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks of 15 June 1957, as amended and revised. Article IP.19: Signs of which a trade mark may consist A trade mark may consist of any signs, in particular words, including personal names, or designs, letters, numerals, colours, the shape of goods or of the packaging of goods, or sounds, provided that such signs are capable of: (a) (b) distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings; and being represented on the respective trade mark register of each Party, in a manner which enables the competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to its proprietor. Article IP.20: Rights conferred by a trade mark 1. Each Party shall provide that the registration of a trade mark confers on the proprietor exclusive rights therein. The proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having the proprietor's consent from using in the course of trade: (a) any sign which is identical with the registered trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the trade mark is registered; any sign where, because of its identity with, or similarity to, the registered trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by this trade mark and the sign, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, including the likelihood of association between the sign and the registered trade mark.

(b)

2. The proprietor of a registered trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties from bringing goods, in the course of trade, into the Party where the trade mark is registered without being released for free circulation there, where such goods, including packaging, come from other countries or the other Party and bear without authorisation a trade mark which is identical to the trade mark registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from that trade mark. 3. The entitlement of the proprietor of a trade mark pursuant to paragraph 2 shall lapse if during the proceedings to determine whether the registered trade mark has been infringed, evidence is provided by the declarant or the holder of the goods that the proprietor of the registered trade mark is not entitled to prohibit the placing of the goods on the market in the country of final destination. Article IP.21: Registration procedure 1. Each Party shall provide for a system for the registration of trade marks in which each final negative decision taken by the relevant trade mark administration, including partial refusals of registration, shall be communicated in writing to the relevant party, duly reasoned and subject to appeal. 132

2. Each Party shall provide for the possibility for third parties to oppose trade mark applications or, where appropriate, trade mark registrations. Such opposition proceedings shall be adversarial. 3. Each Party shall provide a publicly available electronic database of trade mark applications and trade mark registrations. 4. Each Party shall make best efforts to provide a system for the electronic application for and processing, registration and maintenance of trade marks. Article IP.22: Well-known trade marks For the purpose of giving effect to protection of well-known trade marks, as referred to in Article 6bis of the Paris Convention and Article 16(2) and (3) of the TRIPS Agreement, each Party shall apply the Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks, adopted by the Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property and the General Assembly of the WIPO at the Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO on 20 to 29 September 1999. Article IP.23: Exceptions to the rights conferred by a trade mark 1. Each Party shall provide for limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trade mark such as the fair use of descriptive terms including geographical indications, and may provide other limited exceptions, provided such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the proprietor of the trade mark and of third parties. 2. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade: (a) (b) the name or address of the third party, where the third party is a natural person; signs or indications concerning the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of goods or services; or the trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to goods or services as those of the proprietor of that trade mark, in particular where the use of that trade mark is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, in particular as accessories or spare parts,

(c)

provided the third party uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters. 3. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade, an earlier right which only applies in a particular locality if that right is recognised by the laws of the Party in question and is used within the limits of the territory in which it is recognised. Article IP.24: Grounds for revocation 1. Each Party shall provide that a trade mark shall be liable to revocation if, within a continuous period of five years it has not been put to genuine use in the relevant territory of a Party by the proprietor or with the proprietor's consent in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use. 133

2. Each Party shall also provide that a trade mark shall be liable to revocation if within the period of five years following the date of completion of the registration procedure it has not been put to genuine use in the relevant territory by the proprietor or with the proprietor's consent, in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use. 3. However, no person may claim that the proprietor's rights in a trade mark should be revoked where, during the interval between expiry of the five-year period and filing of the application for revocation, genuine use of the trade mark has been started or resumed. The commencement or resumption of use within a period of three months preceding the filing of the application for revocation which began at the earliest on expiry of the continuous period of five years of non-use, shall, however, be disregarded where preparations for the commencement or resumption occur only after the proprietor becomes aware that the application for revocation may be filed. 4. (a) A trade mark shall also be liable to revocation if, after the date on which it was registered: as a consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, it has become the common name in the trade for a good or service in respect of which it is registered; as a consequence of the use made of the trade mark by the proprietor of the trade mark or with the proprietor's consent in respect of the goods or services for which it is registered, it is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of those goods or services. Article IP.25: The right to prohibit preparatory acts in relation to the use of packaging or other means Where the risk exists that the packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the trade mark is affixed could be used in relation to goods or services and that use would constitute an infringement of the rights of the proprietor of the trade mark, the proprietor of that trade mark shall have the right to prohibit the following acts if carried out in the course of trade: (a) affixing a sign identical with, or similar to, the trade mark on packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the mark may be affixed; or offering or placing on the market, or stocking for those purposes, or importing or exporting, packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the mark is affixed. Article IP.26: Bad faith applications A trade mark shall be liable to be declared invalid where the application for registration of the trade mark was made in bad faith by the applicant. Each Party may provide that such a trade mark shall not be registered. Section 3: Design Article IP.27: Protection of registered designs 1. Each Party shall provide for the protection of independently created designs that are new and original. This protection shall be provided by registration and shall confer exclusive rights upon their holders in accordance with this Section. 134

For the purposes of this Article, a Party may consider that a design having individual character is original. 2. The holder of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the holder's consent at least from making, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, stocking the product bearing and embodying the protected design or using articles bearing or embodying the protected design where such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes. 3. A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and original: (a) if the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains visible during normal use of the latter; and to the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the requirements as to novelty and originality.

(b)

4. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 3, "normal use" means use by the end user, excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work. Article IP.28: Duration of protection The duration of protection available for registered designs, including renewals of registered designs, shall amount to a total term of 25 years from the date on which the application was filed36. Article IP.29: Protection of unregistered designs 1. Each Party shall confer on holders of an unregistered design the right to prevent the use of the unregistered design by any third party not having the holder's consent only if the contested use results from copying the unregistered design in their respective territory37. Such use shall at least cover the offering for sale, putting on the market, importing or exporting the product. 2. The duration of protection available for the unregistered design shall amount to at least three years as from the date on which the design was first made available to the public in the territory of the respective Party. Article IP.30: Exceptions and exclusions 1. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, including unregistered designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of designs, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the holder of the design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties. 2. Protection shall not extend to designs solely dictated by technical or functional considerations. A design shall not subsist in features of appearance of a product which must necessarily be reproduced in their exact form and dimensions in order to permit the product in which

the design is incorporated or to which it is applied to be mechanically connected to or placed in, around or against another product so that either product may perform its function. 3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, a design shall, in accordance with the conditions set out in Article IP.27(1) [Protection of registered designs], subsist in a design, which has the purpose of allowing the multiple assembly or connection of mutually interchangeable products within a modular system. Article IP.31: Relationship to copyright Each Party shall ensure that designs, including unregistered designs, shall also be eligible for protection under the copyright law of that Party as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such a protection is conferred, including the level of originality required, shall be determined by each Party. Section 4: Patents Article IP.32: Patents and public health 1. The Parties recognise the importance of the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, adopted on 14 November 2001 by the Ministerial Conference of the WTO at Doha (the "Doha Declaration"). In interpreting and implementing the rights and obligations under this Section, each Party shall ensure consistency with the Doha Declaration. 2. Each Party shall implement Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement, as well as the Annex to the TRIPS Agreement and the Appendix to the Annex to the TRIPS Agreement. Article IP.33: Extension of the period of protection conferred by a patent on medicinal products and on plant protection products 1. The Parties recognise that medicinal products and plant protection products38 protected by a patent in their respective territory may be subject to an administrative authorisation procedure before being put on their respective markets. The Parties recognise that the period that elapses between the filing of the application for a patent and the first authorisation to place the product on the market, as defined for that purpose by the relevant legislation, may shorten the period of effective protection under the patent. 2. Each Party shall provide for further protection, in accordance with its laws and regulations, for a product which is protected by a patent and which has been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure referred to in paragraph 1 to compensate the holder of a patent for the reduction of effective patent protection. The terms and conditions for the provision of such further protection, including its length, shall be determined in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Parties. 3. For the purposes of this Title, "medicinal product" means:

Each Party shall also ensure that, for a limited period of time to be determined by its domestic law and in accordance with any conditions set out in its domestic law, a medicinal product subsequently authorised by that authority on the basis of the results of the pre-clinical tests and clinical trials referred to in paragraph 2 is not placed on the market without the explicit consent of the holder of the first marketing authorisation, unless international agreements to which the Parties are both party provide otherwise. 4.

During such period, the test or study report shall not be used for the benefit of any other person who seeks to obtain a marketing authorisation for an active substance, plant protection product or biocidal product, unless the explicit consent of the first owner has been proved. For the purposes of this Article, that right is referred to as data protection. 2. The test or study report submitted for marketing authorisation of an active substance or plant protection product should fulfil the following conditions: (a) be necessary for the authorisation or for an amendment of an authorisation in order to allow the use on other crops; and be certified as compliant with the principles of good laboratory practice or of good experimental practice.

Each Party shall also take the necessary measures to enable the competent judicial authorities to order, where appropriate, in cases of infringement of an intellectual property right committed on a commercial scale, under the same conditions as in paragraph 1, the communication of banking, financial or commercial documents under the control of the opposing party, subject to the protection of confidential information. Article IP.42: Right of information 1. Each Party shall ensure that, in the context of civil proceedings concerning an infringement of an intellectual property right and in response to a justified and proportionate request of the claimant, the competent judicial authorities may order the infringer or any other person to provide information on the origin and distribution networks of the goods or services which infringe an intellectual property right. 2. (a) (b) (c) (d) For the purposes of paragraph 1, "any other person" means a person who: was found in possession of the infringing goods on a commercial scale; was found to be using the infringing services on a commercial scale; was found to be providing on a commercial scale services used in infringing activities; or was indicated by the person referred to in points (a), (b) or (c), as being involved in the production, manufacture or distribution of the goods or the provision of the services.

Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply without prejudice to other laws of a Party which: grant the right holder rights to receive fuller information; govern the use in civil proceedings of the information communicated pursuant to this Article; govern responsibility for misuse of the right of information; afford an opportunity for refusing to provide information which would force the person referred to in paragraph 1 to admit their own participation or that of their close relatives in an infringement of an intellectual property right; govern the protection of confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data. Article IP.43: Provisional and precautionary measures 1. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities may, at the request of the applicant, issue against the alleged infringer an interlocutory injunction intended to prevent any imminent infringement of an intellectual property right, or to forbid, on a provisional basis and subject, where 141

appropriate, to a recurring penalty payment where provided for by the law of that Party, the continuation of the alleged infringements of that right, or to make such continuation subject to the lodging of guarantees intended to ensure the compensation of the right holder. An interlocutory injunction may also be issued, under the same conditions, against an intermediary whose services are being used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right. 2. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities may, at the request of the applicant, order the seizure or delivery up of goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right, so as to prevent their entry into or movement within the channels of commerce. 3. In the case of an alleged infringement committed on a commercial scale, each Party shall ensure that, if the applicant demonstrates circumstances likely to endanger the recovery of damages, the judicial authorities may order the precautionary seizure of the movable and immovable property of the alleged infringer, including the blocking of their bank accounts and other assets. To that end, the competent authorities may order the communication of bank, financial or commercial documents, or appropriate access to the relevant information. 4. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities shall, in respect of the measures referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, have the authority to require the applicant to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant is the rightholder and that the applicant's right is being infringed, or that such infringement is imminent. Article IP.44: Corrective measures 1. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities may order, at the request of the applicant, without prejudice to any damages due to the right holder by reason of the infringement, and without compensation of any sort, the destruction of goods that they have found to be infringing an intellectual property right or at least the definitive removal of those goods from the channels of commerce. If appropriate, under the same conditions, the judicial authorities may also order destruction of materials and implements predominantly used in the creation or manufacture of those goods. 2. Each Party's judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that those measures shall be carried out at the expense of the infringer, unless particular reasons are invoked for not doing so. Article IP.45: Injunctions Each Party shall ensure that, where a judicial decision is taken finding an infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may issue against the infringer an injunction aimed at prohibiting the continuation of the infringement. Each Party shall also ensure that the judicial authorities may issue an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right. Article IP.46: Alternative measures Each Party may provide that the judicial authorities, in appropriate cases and at the request of the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for in Article IP.44 [Corrective measures] or Article IP.45 [Injunctions], may order pecuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measures provided for in these two Articles if that person acted unintentionally and without negligence, if execution of the measures in question would cause the person disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory. 142

Article IP.47: Damages 1. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities, on application of the injured party, order the infringer who knowingly engaged, or had reasonable grounds to know it was engaging, in an infringing activity, to pay to the rightholder damages appropriate to the actual prejudice suffered by the rightholder as a result of the infringement. 2. (a) Each Party shall ensure that when its judicial authorities set the damages: they take into account all appropriate aspects, such as the negative economic consequences, including lost profits, which the injured party has suffered, any unfair profits made by the infringer and, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors, such as the moral prejudice caused to the right holder by the infringement; or as an alternative to point (a), they may, in appropriate cases, set the damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at least the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.

(b)

3. Where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity, each Party may lay down that the judicial authorities may order the recovery of profits or the payment of damages which may be pre-established. Article IP.48: Legal costs Each Party shall ensure that reasonable and proportionate legal costs and other expenses incurred by the successful party shall, as a general rule, be borne by the unsuccessful party, unless equity does not allow this. Article IP.49: Publication of judicial decisions Each Party shall ensure that, in legal proceedings instituted for infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may order, at the request of the applicant and at the expense of the infringer, appropriate measures for the dissemination of the information concerning the decision, including displaying the decision and publishing it in full or in part. Article IP.50: Presumption of authorship or ownership For the purposes of applying the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in Chapter 3 [Enforcement of intellectual property rights]: (a) for the author of a literary or artistic work, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to be regarded as such, and consequently to be entitled to institute infringement proceedings, it shall be sufficient for the author's name to appear on the work in the usual manner; and point (a) applies mutatis mutandis to the holders of rights related to copyright with regard to their protected subject matter.

2. A Party may notify the other Party of an objection to a proposed rectification within 45 days from having received the notification. A Party submitting an objection shall set out the reasons for considering the proposed rectification not as a change provided for in paragraph 1, and describe the effect of the proposed rectification on the mutually agreed market access commitments provided for in this Title.

Article 3.1: Definitions 1. a) For the purposes of this Chapter: "economic actor" means an entity or a group of entities constituting a single economic entity, regardless of its legal status, that is engaged in an economic activity by offering goods or services on a market; "subsidy" means financial assistance which: (i) arises from the resources of the Parties, including: (A) a direct or contingent transfer of funds such as direct grants, loans or loan guarantees; (B) the forgoing of revenue that is otherwise due; or (C) the provision of goods or services, or the purchase of goods or services; (ii) confers an economic advantage on one or more economic actors; (iii) is specific insofar as it benefits, as a matter of law or fact, certain economic actors over others in relation to the production of certain goods or services; and (iv) has, or could have, an effect on trade or investment between the Parties. 2. (a) For the purposes of point (b)(iii) of paragraph 1: a tax measure shall not be considered as specific unless: (i) certain economic actors obtain a reduction in the tax liability that they otherwise would have borne under the normal taxation regime; and (ii) those economic actors are treated more advantageously than others in a comparable position within the normal taxation regime; for the purposes of this point, a normal taxation regime is defined by its internal objective, by its features (such as the tax base, the taxable person, the taxable event or the tax rate) and by an authority which is autonomous institutionally, procedurally, economically and financially and has the competence to design the features of the taxation regime. (b) notwithstanding point (a), a subsidy shall not be regarded as specific if it is justified by principles inherent to the design of the general system. In the case of tax measures, examples of such inherent principles are the need to fight fraud or tax evasion, administrative manageability, the avoidance of double taxation, the principle of tax neutrality, the progressive nature of income tax and its redistributive purpose, or the need to respect taxpayers' ability to pay; notwithstanding point (a), special purpose levies shall not be regarded as specific if their design is required by non-economic public policy objectives, such as the need to limit the negative

impacts of certain activities or products on the environment or human health, insofar as the public policy objectives are not discriminatory53. Article 3.2: Scope and exceptions 1. Article 3.4 [Principles], 3.5 [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions] and Article 3.12 [Remedial measures] do not apply to subsidies granted to compensate the damage caused by natural disasters or other exceptional non-economic occurrences. 2. Nothing in this Chapter prevents the Parties from granting subsidies of a social character that are targeted at final consumers. 3. Subsidies that are granted on a temporary basis to respond to a national or global economic emergency shall be targeted, proportionate and effective in order to remedy that emergency. Articles 3.5 [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions] and 3.12 [Remedial measures] do not apply to such subsidies. 4. This Chapter does not apply to subsidies where the total amount granted to a single economic actor is below 325,000 Special Drawing Rights over any period of three fiscal years.

Article 3.3: Services of public economic interest 1. Subsidies granted to economic actors assigned with particular tasks in the public interest, including public service obligations, are subject to Article 3.4 [Principles] insofar as the application of the principles set out in that Article does not obstruct the performance in law or fact of the particular task assigned to the economic actor concerned. The task shall be assigned in advance in a transparent manner. 2. The Parties shall ensure that the amount of compensation granted to an economic actor that is assigned with a task in the public interest is limited to what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of that task, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging that task. The Parties shall ensure that the compensation granted is not used to cross-subsidise activities falling outside the scope of the assigned task. Compensation below 15 million

This Chapter does not apply where the total compensation to an economic actor providing tasks in the public interest is below 750,000 Special Drawing Rights over any period of three fiscal years. The Partnership Council may amend this threshold. Article 3.4: Principles 1. With a view to ensuring that subsidies are not granted where they have or could have a material effect on trade or investment between the Parties, each Party shall have in place and maintain an effective system of subsidy control that ensures that the granting of a subsidy respects the following principles: a) subsidies pursue a specific public policy objective to remedy an identified market failure or to address an equity rationale such as social difficulties or distributional concerns ("the objective"); subsidies are proportionate and limited to what is necessary to achieve the objective; subsidies are designed to bring about a change of economic behaviour of the beneficiary that is conducive to achieving the objective and that would not be achieved in the absence of subsidies being provided; subsidies should not normally compensate for the costs the beneficiary would have funded in the absence of any subsidy; subsidies are an appropriate policy instrument to achieve a public policy objective and that objective cannot be achieved through other less distortive means; subsidies' positive contributions to achieving the objective outweigh any negative effects, in particular the negative effects on trade or investment between the Parties.

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, each Party shall apply the conditions set out in Article 3.5 [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions], where relevant, if the subsidies concerned have or could have a material effect on trade or investment between the Parties. 3. It is for each Party to determine how its obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2 are implemented in the design of its subsidy control system in its own domestic law, provided that each Party shall ensure that the obligations in paragraphs 1 and 2 are implemented in its law in such a manner that the legality of an individual subsidy will be determined by the principles. Article 3.5 Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions 1. The categories of the subsidies referred to in Article 3.4(2) [Principles] and the conditions to be applied to them are as follows. The Partnership Council may update these provisions as necessary to ensure the operation of this Article over time. Unlimited state guarantees 2. Subsidies in the form of a guarantee of debts or liabilities of an economic actor without any limitation as to the amount of those debts and liabilities or the duration of that guarantee shall be prohibited. 184

Rescue and restructuring 3. Subsidies for restructuring an ailing or insolvent economic actor without the economic actor having prepared a credible restructuring plan shall be prohibited. The restructuring plan shall be based on realistic assumptions with a view to ensuring the return to long-term viability of the ailing or insolvent economic actor within a reasonable time period. During the preparation of the restructuring plan, the economic actor can receive temporary liquidity support in the form of loans or loan guarantees. Except for small and medium-sized enterprises, an economic actor or its owners, creditors or new investors shall contribute significant funds or assets to the cost of restructuring. For the purposes of this paragraph, an ailing or insolvent economic actor is one that would almost certainly go out of business in the short to medium term without the subsidy 4. Other than in exceptional circumstances, subsidies for the rescue and restructuring of insolvent or ailing economic actors should only be allowed if they contribute to an objective of public interest by avoiding social hardship or preventing a severe market failure, in particular with regard to job losses or disruption of an important service that is difficult to replicate. Except in the case of unforeseeable circumstances not caused by the beneficiary, they should not be granted more than once in any five year period. 5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to subsidies to ailing or insolvent banks, credit institutions and insurance companies. Banks, credit institutions and insurance companies 6. Without prejudice to Article SERVIN 5.39 [Prudential carve-out], subsidies to restructure banks, credit institutions and insurance companies may only be granted on the basis of a credible restructuring plan that restores long-term viability. If a return to long-term viability cannot be credibly demonstrated, any subsidy to banks, credit institutions and insurance companies shall be limited to what is needed to ensure their orderly liquidation and exit from the market while minimising the amount of the subsidy and its negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties. 7. It shall be ensured that the granting authority is properly remunerated for the restructuring subsidy and that the beneficiary, its shareholders, its creditors or the business group to which the beneficiary belongs, contribute significantly to the restructuring or liquidation costs from their own resources. Subsidies to support liquidity provisions shall be temporary, shall not be used to absorb losses and shall not become capital support. Proper remuneration shall be paid to the granting authority for the subsidies granted to support liquidity provisions. Export subsidies 8. Subsidies that are contingent in law or in fact54, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon export performance relating to goods or services, shall be prohibited, except in relation to: (a) short-term credit insurance for non-marketable risks; or

54

For greater certainty, this standard is met when the facts demonstrate that the granting of a subsidy, without having been made legally contingent upon export performance, is in fact tied to actual or anticipated exportation or export earnings. The mere fact that a subsidy is granted to economic actors which export shall not for that reason alone be considered to be an export subsidy within the meaning of this provision.

export credits and export credit guarantee or insurance programmes that are permissible in accordance with the SCM Agreement, read with any adjustments necessary for context.

9. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 8 "marketable risk" means commercial and political risks with a maximum risk period of less than two years on public and non-public buyers in marketable risk countries55. A country may be understood to be temporarily removed from the group of marketable risk countries if there is a lack of sufficient private market capacity because of: (a) (b) (c) a significant contraction of private credit insurance capacity; a significant deterioration of sovereign sector rating; or a significant deterioration of corporate sector performance.

10. Such temporary removal of a marketable risk country shall take effect, as far as a Party is concerned, in accordance with a decision of that Party on the basis of the criteria in paragraph 9, and only if that Party adopts such a decision. The publication of that decision shall be deemed to constitute notification to the other Party of such temporary removal as far as the former Party is concerned. 11. If a subsidised insurer provides export credit insurance, any insurance for marketable risks shall be provided on a commercial basis. In such a case, the insurer shall not directly or indirectly benefit from subsidies for the provision of insurance for marketable risks. Subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic content 12. Without prejudice to Article SERVIN 2.6 [Performance requirements] and Article SERVIN 2.7 [Non-conforming measures and exceptions], subsidies contingent, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over imported goods or services shall be prohibited. Large cross border or international cooperation projects 13. Subsidies may be granted in the context of large cross border or international cooperation projects, such as those for transport, energy, the environment, research and development, and first deployment projects to incentivise the emergence and deployment of new technologies (excluding manufacturing). The benefits of such cross border or international cooperation projects must not be limited to the economic actors or to the sector or the States participating, but must have wider benefit and relevance through spill over effects that do not exclusively accrue to the State that grants the subsidy, the relevant sector and beneficiary. Energy and environment 14. The Parties recognise the importance of a secure, affordable and sustainable energy system and environmental sustainability, notably in relation to the fight against climate change which represent an existential threat to humanity. Therefore, without prejudice to Article 3.4 [Principles], the subsidies in relation to energy and environment shall be aimed at, and incentivise the beneficiary in, delivering a secure, affordable and sustainable energy system and a well-functioning and competitive energy market or increasing the level of environmental protection compared to the level

The marketable risk countries are the United Kingdom, the Member States of the Union, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States of America.

that would be achieved in absence of the subsidy. Such subsidies shall not relieve the beneficiary from liabilities arising from its responsibilities as a polluter under the law of the relevant Party. Subsidies to air carriers for the operation of routes 15. (a) Subsidies shall not be granted to an air carrier56 for the operation of routes except: where there is a public service obligation, in accordance with Article 3.3 [Services of public economic interest]; in special cases where this funding provides benefits for society at large; or as start-up subsidies for opening new routes to regional airports providing that it increases the mobility of citizens and stimulates regional development. Article 3.6: Use of subsidies Each Party shall ensure that economic actors use subsidies only for the specific purpose for which they are granted. Article 3.7: Transparency 1. With respect to any subsidy granted or maintained within its territory, each Party shall within six months from the granting of the subsidy make publicly available, on an official website or a public database, the following information: the legal basis and policy objective or purpose of the subsidy; the name of the recipient of the subsidy when available; the date of the grant of the subsidy, the duration of the subsidy and any other time limits attached to the subsidy; and the amount of the subsidy or the amount budgeted for the subsidy.

2. For subsidies in the form of tax measures, the information shall be made public within one year from the date the tax declaration is due. The transparency obligations for subsidies in the form of tax measures concern the same information as listed in paragraph 1, except for the information required under point (d) of that paragraph, which may be provided as a range. 3. In addition to the obligation set out in paragraph 1, the Parties shall make subsidy information available in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 5 below. 4. For the Union, compliance with paragraph 3 means that with respect to any subsidy granted or maintained within its territory, within six months from the grant of the subsidy, information is made publicly available, on an official website or a public database, that allows interested parties to assess the compliance with the principles set out in Article 3.4 [Principles].

56

For greater certainty, this is without prejudice to paragraphs Article 3.2(1) and (2) [Scope and exceptions].

5. For the United Kingdom, compliance with paragraph 3 means that the United Kingdom shall ensure that: (a) if an interested party communicates to the granting authority that it may apply for a review by a court or tribunal of (i) the grant of a subsidy by a granting authority or (ii) any relevant decision by the granting authority or the independent body or authority; then, within 28 days of the request being made in writing, the granting authority, independent body or authority will provide that interested party with the information that allows the interested party to assess the application of the principles set out in Article 3.4 [Principles], subject to any proportionate restrictions which pursue a legitimate objective, such as commercial sensitivity, confidentiality or legal privilege.

(b)

The information referred to in point (b) of the first sub-paragraph shall be provided to the interested party for the purposes of enabling it to make an informed decision as to whether to make a claim or to understand and properly identify the issues in dispute in the proposed claim. 6. For the purposes of this Article, Article 3.10 [Courts and tribunals] and Article 3.11 [Recovery], "interested party" means any natural or legal person, economic actor or association of economic actors whose interest might be affected by the granting of a subsidy, in particular the beneficiary, economic actors competing with the beneficiary or relevant trade associations. 7. The obligations in this Article are without prejudice to the obligations of the Parties under their respective laws concerning freedom of information or access to documents. Article 3.8: Consultations on subsidy control 1. If a Party considers that a subsidy has been granted by the other Party or that there is clear evidence that the other Party intends to grant a subsidy and that the granting of the subsidy has or could have a negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties, it may request the other Party to provide an explanation of how the Principles referred to in Article 3.4 [Principles] have been respected with regard to that subsidy. 2. A Party may also request the information listed in Article 3.7(1) [Transparency] to the extent that the information has not already been made publicly available on an official website or a public database as referred to in Article 3.7(1) [Transparency], or to the extent that the information has not been made available in an easily and readily accessible manner. 3. The other Party shall provide the requested information in writing no later than 60 days of the receipt of the request. If any requested information cannot be provided, that Party shall explain the absence of such information in its written response. 4. If after receiving the information requested, the requesting Party still considers that the subsidy granted or intended to be granted by the other Party has or could have a negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties, the requesting Party may request consultations within the Trade Specialised Committee on the Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development. The request shall be in writing and shall include an explanation of the requesting Party's reasons for requesting the consultation. 5. The Trade Specialised Committee on the Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development shall make every attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter. It shall hold its first meeting within 30 days of the request for consultation. 188

6. The timeframes for the consultations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 5 may be extended by agreement between the Parties. Article 3.9: Independent authority or body and cooperation 1. Each Party shall establish or maintain an operationally independent authority or body with an appropriate role in its subsidy control regime. That independent authority or body shall have the necessary guarantees of independence in exercising its operational functions and shall act impartially. 2. The Parties shall encourage their respective independent authorities or bodies to cooperate with each other on issues of common interest within their respective functions, including the application of Articles 3.1 [Definitions] to 3.7 [Transparency] as applicable, within the limits established by their respective legal frameworks. The Parties, or their respective independent authorities or bodies, may agree upon a separate framework regarding cooperation between those independent authorities. Article 3.10: Courts and tribunals 1. Each Party shall ensure, in accordance with its general and constitutional laws and procedures, that its courts or tribunals are competent to: a) review subsidy decisions taken by a granting authority or, where relevant, the independent authority or body for compliance with that Party's law implementing Article 3.4 [Principles]; review any other relevant decisions of the independent authority or body and any relevant failure to act; impose remedies that are effective in relation to points a) or b), including suspension, prohibition or requirement of action by the granting authority, the award of damages, and recovery of subsidy from its beneficiary if and to the extent they are available under the respective laws on the date of entry into force of this Agreement; hear claims from interested parties in respect of subsidies that are subject to this Chapter; where an interested party has standing to bring a claim in respect of a subsidy under that Party's law.

2. Each Party shall have the right to intervene with the permission, where required, of the court or tribunal concerned, in accordance with the general laws and procedures of the other Party in cases referred to in paragraph 1. 3. Without prejudice to the obligations to maintain or, where necessary, to create the competencies, remedies and rights of intervention referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and Article 3.11 [Recovery], nothing in this Article requires either Party to create rights of action, remedies, procedures, or the scope or grounds of review of decisions of their respective public authorities, beyond those existing under its law on the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Nothing in this Article requires either Party to widen the scope or grounds of review by its courts and tribunals of Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament, of acts of the European Parliament and the Council

of the European Union, or of acts of the Council of the European Union beyond those existing under its law on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.57 Article 3.11: Recovery 1. Each Party shall have in place an effective mechanism of recovery in respect of subsidies in accordance with the following provisions, without prejudice to other remedies that exist in that Party's law.58 2. Each Party shall ensure that, provided that the interested party as defined in Article 3.7(6) [Transparency] has challenged a decision to grant a subsidy before a court or a tribunal within the specified time period, as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article, recovery may be ordered if a court or tribunal of a Party makes a finding of a material error of law, in that: (a) (b) a measure constituting a subsidy was not treated by the grantor as a subsidy; the grantor of a subsidy has failed to apply the principles set out in Article 3.4 [Principles], as implemented in that Party's law, or applied them in a manner which falls below the standard of review applicable in that Party's law; or the grantor of a subsidy has, by deciding to grant that subsidy, acted outside the scope of its powers or misused those powers in relation to the principles set out in Article 3.4 [Principles], as implemented in that Party's law. For the purposes of this Article, the specified time period shall be determined as follows: for the Union, it shall commence on the date on which information specified in Article 3.7(1), (2) and (4) [Transparency] was made available on the official website or public database and be no shorter than one month. for the United Kingdom: (i) it shall commence on the date on which information specified in Article 3.7(1) and (2) [Transparency] was made available on the official website or public database; (ii) it shall terminate one month later, unless, prior to that date, the interested party has requested information under the process specified in paragraph 5 of Article 3.7; (iii) once the interested party has received the information identified in Article 3.7(5)(b) sufficient for the purposes identified in that paragraph, there shall be a further one month period at the end of which the specified time period shall terminate;

For greater certainty, the law of the United Kingdom for the purposes of this Article does not include any law [i] having effect by virtue of section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972, as saved by section 1A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, or [ii] passed or made under, or for a purpose specified in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. 58 For the United Kingdom, this Article requires a new remedy of recovery which would be available at the end of a successful judicial review, in accordance with the standard of review under national law, commenced within the specified time period; such review is not expanded in any other way, in accordance with Article 3.10(3) [Courts and tribunals]. No beneficiary would be able to raise a legitimate expectation to resist such recovery.

(iv) the date of receipt of the information in point (iii) will be the date on which the granting authority certifies that it has provided the information identified in Article 3.7(5)(b) [Transparency] sufficient for those purposes, irrespective of further or clarificatory correspondence after that date; (v) the time periods identified in points (i) to (iii) may be increased by legislation. 4. For the purposes of paragraph 3(b), in relation to schemes, the specified time period commences when the information under point (b) is published, not when subsequent payments are made, where: (a) (b) a subsidy is ostensibly granted in accordance with the terms of a scheme; the maker of the scheme has made publicly available the information required to be published by Article 3.7(1) and (2) [Transparency] in respect of the scheme; and the information provided about the scheme under point (b) contains information about the subsidy that would enable an interested party to determine whether it may be affected by the scheme, which at a minimum shall cover the purpose of the subsidy, the categories of beneficiary, the terms and conditions of eligibility for subsidy and the basis for the calculation of the subsidy (including any relevant conditions relating to subsidy ratios or amounts).

(c)

5. For the purposes of this Article, recovery of a subsidy is not required where a subsidy is granted on the basis of an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, of an act of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, or of an act of the Council of the European Union. 6. Nothing in this Article prevents a Party from choosing to provide additional situations where recovery is a remedy, beyond those specified in this Article, in accordance with its law. 7. The Parties recognise that recovery is an important remedial tool in any system of subsidy control. At the request of either Party, the Parties shall, within the Partnership Council consider additional or alternative mechanisms for recovery, as well as corresponding amendments to this Article. Within the Partnership Council, either Party may propose amendments to allow for different arrangements for their respective mechanisms for recovery. A Party must consider a proposal made by the other Party in good faith and agree to it, provided that this Party considers that it contains arrangements which represent at least as effective a means of delivering recovery as the existing mechanisms of the other Party. The Partnership Council may then make corresponding amendments to this Article.59 Article 3.12: Remedial measures 1. A Party may deliver to the other Party a written request for information and consultations regarding a subsidy that it considers causes, or there is a serious risk that it will cause, a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties. The requesting Party should provide in that request all relevant information to enable the Parties to find a mutually acceptable solution,

The Parties note that the United Kingdom will implement a new system of subsidy control subsequent to the entry into force of this Agreement.

including a description of the subsidy and the concerns of the requesting Party regarding its effect on trade or investment. 2. No later than 30 days from the date of delivery of the request the requested Party shall deliver a written response providing the requested information to the requesting Party, and the Parties shall enter into consultations, which shall be deemed concluded 60 days from the date of delivery of that request, unless the Parties agree otherwise. Such consultations, and in particular all information designated as confidential and positions taken by the Parties during consultations, shall be confidential, and shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party in any further proceedings. 3. No earlier than 60 days from the date of delivery of the request referred to in paragraph 1, the requesting Party may unilaterally take appropriate remedial measures if there is evidence that a subsidy of the requested Party causes, or there is a serious risk that it will cause a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties. 4. No earlier than 45 days from the date of delivery of the request referred to in paragraph 1, the requesting Party shall notify the requested Party of the remedial measures that it intends to take in accordance with paragraph 3. The requesting Party shall provide all relevant information in relation to the measures that it intends to take to enable the Parties to find a mutually acceptable solution. The requesting Party may not take those remedial measures earlier than 15 days from the date of delivery of the notification of those measures to the requested Party. 5. A Party's assessment of the existence of a serious risk of a significant negative effect shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. The change in circumstances that would create a situation in which the subsidy would cause such a significant negative effect must be clearly predictable. 6. A Party's assessment of the existence of a subsidy or of a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties caused by the subsidy shall be based on reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture or remote possibility, and shall relate to identifiable goods, service suppliers or other economic actors, including, if relevant, in the case of subsidy schemes. 7. The Partnership Council may maintain an illustrative list of what would amount to a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties within the meaning of paragraphs 1 and 3. This shall be without prejudice to the right of the Parties to take remedial measures. 8. The remedial measures taken pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be restricted to what is strictly necessary and proportionate in order to remedy the significant negative effect caused or to address the serious risk of such an effect. Priority shall be given to measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. 9. Within five days from the date on which the remedial measures referred to in paragraph 3 enter into effect and without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations], the notified Party may request, in accordance with Article INST.14(2) [Arbitration procedure], the establishment of an arbitration tribunal by means of a written request delivered to the requesting Party in order for the arbitration tribunal to decide whether: (a) (b) a remedial measure taken by the requesting Party is inconsistent with paragraph 3 or 8; the requesting Party did not participate in the consultations after the requested Party delivered the requested information and agreed to the holding of such consultations; or 192

(c)

there was a failure to take or notify a remedial measure in accordance with the time periods referred to in paragraph 3 or 4 respectively.

That request shall not have a suspensive effect on the remedial measures. Furthermore, the arbitration tribunal shall not assess the application by the Parties of Articles 3.4 [Principles] and 3.5 [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions]. 10. The arbitration tribunal established following the request referred to in paragraph 9 shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with Article INST.34B [Special procedures for remedial measures and rebalancing] and deliver its final ruling within 30 days from its establishment. 11. In the case of a finding against the respondent Party, the respondent Party shall, at the latest 30 days from the date of delivery of the ruling of the arbitration tribunal, deliver a notification to the complaining Party of any measure that it has taken to comply with that ruling. 12. Following a finding against the respondent Party in the procedure referred to in paragraph 10, the complaining Party may request the arbitration tribunal, within 30 days from its ruling, to determine a level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement or a supplementing agreement not exceeding the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the application of the remedial measures, if it finds that the inconsistency of the remedial measures with paragraphs 3 or 8 is significant. The request shall propose a level of suspension of obligations in accordance with the principles set out in Article INST.34C [Suspension of obligations for the purposes of Article LPFS.3.12(12)[Remedial measures], Article FISH.9(5) and Article FISH.14(6)]. The complaining Party may suspend obligations under this Agreement or a supplementing agreement in accordance with the level of suspension of obligations determined by the arbitration tribunal. Such suspension shall not be applied sooner than 15 days following such ruling. 13. A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from taking measures pursuant to this Article, including where those measures consist in the suspension of obligations under this Agreement or under a supplementing agreement. 14. For the purposes of assessing whether imposing or maintaining remedial measures on imports of the same product is restricted to what is strictly necessary or proportionate for the purposes of this Article, a Party: (a) shall take into account countervailing measures applied or maintained pursuant to Article GOODS.17(3) [Trade Remedies] of Title IV [Trade in goods]; and may take into account anti-dumping measures applied or maintained pursuant to Article GOODS.17(3) [Trade Remedies] of Title IV [Trade in goods].

(b)

15. A Party shall not apply simultaneously a remedial measure under this Article and a rebalancing measure under Article 9.4 [Rebalancing] to remedy the impact on trade or investment caused directly by the same subsidy. 16. If the Party against which remedial measures were taken does not submit a request pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article within the time period laid down in that paragraph, that Party may initiate the arbitration procedure referred to in Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure] to challenge a remedial measure on the grounds set out in paragraph 9 of this Article without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent proceedings]. 193

17. For the purposes of the proceedings under paragraphs 9 and 16, in assessing whether a remedial measure is strictly necessary or proportionate, the arbitration tribunal shall pay due regard to the principles set out in paragraphs 5 and 6, as well as to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15. Article 3.13: Dispute settlement 1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six [Dispute settlement and horizontal provisions] applies to disputes between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of this Chapter, except for Articles 3.9 [Independent authority or body and cooperation] and 3.10 [Courts and tribunals]. 2. (a) An arbitration tribunal shall have no jurisdiction regarding: an individual subsidy, including whether such a subsidy has respected the principles set out in paragraph 1 of Article 3.4 [Principles], other than with regard to the conditions set out in Article 3.5(2) [Unlimited state guarantees], (3) to (5) [Rescue and restructuring], (8) to (11) [Export subsidies] and (12) [Subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic content]; and whether the recovery remedy within the meaning of Article 3.11 [Recovery] has been correctly applied in any individual case.

A Party may request consultations with the other Party regarding any matter arising under Article 1.1(3) [Principles and objectives] of Chapter 1 [General provisions], and Chapters 6 [Labour and social standards], 7 [Environment and climate], and 8 [Other instruments for trade and sustainable development] by delivering a written request to the other Party. The complaining Party shall specify in its written request the reasons and basis for the request, including identification of the measures at issue, specifying the provisions it considers applicable. Consultations must commence promptly after a Party delivers a request for consultations and in any event not later than 30 days after the date of delivery of the request, unless the Parties agree to a longer period. 2. The Parties shall enter into consultations with the aim of reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter. During consultations, each Party shall provide the other Party with sufficient information in its possession to allow a full examination of the matters raised. Each Party shall endeavour to ensure the participation of personnel of their competent authorities who have expertise in the matter subject to the consultations. 3. In matters relating to the multilateral agreements or instruments referred to in Article 1.1(3) [Principle and objectives], Chapters 6 [Labour and social standards], 7 [Environment and climate], and 8 [Other instruments for trade and sustainable development] the Parties shall take into account available information from the ILO or relevant bodies or organisations established under multilateral environmental agreements. Where relevant, the Parties shall jointly seek advice from such organisations or their bodies, or any other expert or body they deem appropriate. 4. Each Party may seek, when appropriate, the views of the domestic advisory groups referred to in Article INST.7 [Domestic advisory groups] or other expert advice. 5. Any resolution reached by the Parties shall be made available to the public. Article 9.2: Panel of experts 1. For any matter that is not satisfactorily addressed through consultations under Article 9.1 [Consultations], a Party may, after 90 days from the receipt of a request for consultations under that Article, request that a panel of experts be convened to examine that matter, by delivering a written request to the other Party. The request shall identify the measure at issue, specify and explain how that measure does not conform with the provisions of the relevant Chapter or Chapters in a manner sufficient to present the complaint clearly. 2. The panel of experts shall be composed of three panellists.

3. The Trade Specialised Committee on the Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development shall, at its first meeting after the entry into force of this Agreement, establish a list of at least 15 individuals who are willing and able to serve as panellists. Each Party shall name at least five individuals to the list to serve as panellists. The Parties shall also name at least five individuals who are not nationals of either Party and who are willing and able to serve as chairperson of a panel of experts.

They shall not be persons who are members, officials or other servants of the Union institutions, of the Government of a Member State, of the Government of the United Kingdom. 5. Unless the Parties agree otherwise within five days from the date of establishment of the panel of experts, the terms of reference shall be: "to examine, in the light of the relevant provisions, the matter referred to in the request for the establishment of the panel of experts, and to deliver a report, in accordance with this Article that makes findings on the conformity of the measure with the relevant provisions." 6. In respect of matters related to multilateral standards or agreements covered in this Title, the panel of experts should seek information from the ILO or relevant bodies established under those agreements, including any pertinent available interpretative guidance, findings or decisions adopted by the ILO and those bodies. 7. The panel of experts may request and receive written submissions or any other information from persons with relevant information or specialised knowledge. 8. The panel of experts shall make available such information to each Party allowing them to submit their comments within 20 days of its receipt. 9. The panel of experts shall issue to the Parties an interim report and a final report setting out the findings of fact, its determinations on the matter including as to whether the responding Party has conformed with its obligations under the relevant Chapter or Chapters and the rationale behind any findings and determinations that it makes. For greater certainty, the Parties share the understanding that if the Panel makes recommendations in its report, the responding Party does not need to follow these recommendations in ensuring conformity with the Agreement. 10. The panel of experts shall deliver to the Parties the interim report within 100 days after the date of establishment of the panel of experts. When the panel of experts considers that this deadline cannot be met, the chairperson of the panel of experts shall notify the Parties in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the panel of experts plans to deliver its interim report. The panel of experts shall, under no circumstances, deliver its interim report later than 125 days after the date of establishment of the panel of experts. 11. Each Party may deliver to the panel of experts a reasoned request to review particular aspects of the interim report within 25 days of its delivery. A Party may comment on the other's Party's request within 15 days of the delivery of the request. 12. After considering those comments, the panel of experts shall prepare the final report. If no request to review particular aspects of the interim report is delivered within the time period referred to in paragraph 11, the interim report shall become the final report of the panel of experts. 13. The panel of experts shall deliver its final report to the Parties within 175 days of the date of establishment of the panel of experts. When the panel of experts considers that this time limit cannot be met, its chairperson shall notify the Parties in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the panel of experts plans to deliver its final report. The panel of experts shall, under no circumstances, deliver its final report later than 195 days after the date of establishment of the panel of experts. 213

14. The final report shall include a discussion of any written request by the Parties on the interim report and clearly address the comments of the Parties. 15. The Parties shall make the final report available to the public within 15 days of its delivery by the panel of experts. 16. If the final report of the panel of experts determines that a Party has not conformed with its obligations under the relevant Chapter or Chapters, the Parties shall, within 90 days of the delivery of the final report, discuss appropriate measures to be implemented taking into account the report of the panel of experts. No later than 105 days after the report has been delivered to the Parties, the respondent Party shall inform its domestic advisory groups established under Article INST.7 [Domestic advisory groups] and the complaining Party of its decision on any measures to be implemented. 17. The Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development shall monitor the follow-up to the report of the panel of experts. The domestic advisory groups of the Parties established under Article INST.7 [Domestic advisory groups] may submit observations to the Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development in that regard. 18. When the Parties disagree on the existence of, or the consistency with, the relevant provisions of any measure taken to address the non-conformity, the complaining Party may deliver a request, which shall be in writing, to the original panel of experts to decide on the matter. The request shall identify any measure at issue and explain how that measure is not in conformity with the relevant provisions in a manner sufficient to present the complaint clearly. The panel of experts shall deliver its findings to the Parties within 45 days of the date of the delivery of the request. 19. Except as otherwise provided for in this Article, Article INST.14(1) [Arbitration procedure], Article INST.29 [Arbitration tribunal decisions and rulings], Article INST.30 [Suspension and termination of the arbitration proceedings], Article INST.31 [Mutually agreed solution], Article INST.32 [Time periods], Article INST.34 [Costs], Article INST.15 [Establishment of an arbitration tribunal], or Article INST.28 [Replacement of arbitrators] as well as ANNEX INST [Rules of Procedure for Dispute Settlement] and ANNEX INST-X [Code of Conduct for Arbitrators], shall apply mutatis mutandis. Article 9.3: Panel of experts for non-regression areas 1. Article 9.2 [Panel of experts] shall apply to disputes between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of Chapter 6 [Labour and Social Standards] and Chapter 7 [Environment and Climate]. 2. For the purposes of such disputes, in addition to the Articles listed in Article 9.2(19) [Panel of experts], Article INST.24 [Temporary remedies] and Article INST.25 [Review of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies] shall apply mutatis mutandis. 3. The Parties recognise that, where the responding Party chooses not to take any action to conform with the report of the panel of experts report and with this Agreement, any remedies authorised under Article INST.24 [Temporary remedies] continue to be available to the complaining Party. Article 9.4: Rebalancing 1. The Parties recognise the right of each Party to determine its future policies and priorities with respect to labour and social, environmental or climate protection, or with respect to subsidy control, 214

in a manner consistent with each Party's international commitments, including those under this Agreement. At the same time, the Parties acknowledge that significant divergences in these areas can be capable of impacting trade or investment between the Parties in a manner that changes the circumstances that have formed the basis for the conclusion of this Agreement. 2. If material impacts on trade or investment between the Parties are arising as a result of significant divergences between the Parties in the areas referred to in paragraph 1, either Party may take appropriate rebalancing measures to address the situation. Such measures shall be restricted with respect to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary and proportionate in order to remedy the situation. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. A Party's assessment of these impacts shall be based on reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture or remote possibility. 3. (a) The following procedures shall apply to rebalancing measures taken under paragraph 2: The concerned Party shall, without delay, notify the other Party through the Partnership Council of the rebalancing measures it intends to take , providing all relevant information. The Parties shall immediately enter into consultations. Consultations shall be deemed concluded within 14 days from the date of delivery of the notification, unless they are jointly concluded before that time limit. If no mutually acceptable solution is found, the concerned Party may adopt rebalancing measures no sooner than five days from the conclusion of the consultations, unless the notified Party requests within the same five day period, in accordance with Article INST.14(2) [Arbitration procedure]64, the establishment of an arbitration tribunal by means of a written request delivered to the other Party in order for the arbitration tribunal to decide whether the notified rebalancing measures are consistent with paragraph 2 of this Article. The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its final ruling within 30 days from its establishment. If the arbitration tribunal does not deliver its final ruling within that time period, the concerned Party may adopt the rebalancing measures no sooner than three days after the expiry of that 30 day time period. In that case, the other Party may take countermeasures proportionate to the adopted rebalancing measures until the arbitration tribunal delivers its ruling. Priority shall be given to such countermeasures as will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. Point (a) shall apply mutatis mutandis to such countermeasures, which may be adopted no sooner than three days after the conclusion of consultations. If the arbitration tribunal has found the rebalancing measures to be consistent with paragraph 2, the concerned Party may adopt the rebalancing measures as notified to the other Party. If the arbitration tribunal has found the rebalancing measures to be inconsistent with paragraph 2, the concerned Party shall, within three days from the delivery of the ruling, notify the complaining Party of the measures65 it intends to adopt to comply with the ruling of the arbitration tribunal.

For greater certainty, in this case the Party shall not have prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. 65 Such measures may include withdrawal or adjustment of the rebalancing measures, as appropriate 66 Suspension of obligations under Article INST.24 [Temporary remedies] shall be available only if rebalancing measures have in fact been applied.

and INST.25 [Review of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies] shall apply mutatis mutandis, if the complaining Party considers that the notified measures are not in compliance with the ruling of the arbitration tribunal. The procedures under Articles INST.23(2) [Compliance review], INST.24 [Temporary measures] and INST.25 [Review of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies] shall have no suspensive effect on the application of the notified measures pursuant to this paragraph. (f) If rebalancing measures were adopted prior to the arbitration ruling in accordance with point (c), any countermeasures adopted pursuant to that point shall be withdrawn immediately, and in no case later than five days, after delivery of the ruling of the arbitration tribunal. A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from taking measures pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3, including when those measures consist of suspension of obligations under this Agreement. If the notified Party does not submit a request pursuant to point (b) within the time period laid down therein, that Party may without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations] initiate the arbitration procedure referred to in Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent proceedings].

4. In order to ensure an appropriate balance between the commitments made by the Parties in this Agreement on a more durable basis, either Party may request, no sooner than four years after the entry into force of this Agreement, a review of the operation of Heading One [Trade] of this Agreement. The Parties may agree that other Headings of this Agreement may be added to the review. 5. Such a review shall commence at a Party's request, if that Party considers that measures under paragraphs 2 or 3 have been taken frequently by either or both Parties, or if a measure that has a material impact on the trade or investment between the Parties has been applied for a period of 12 months. For the purposes of this paragraph, the measures in question are those which were not challenged or not found by an arbitration tribunal to be strictly unnecessary pursuant to point (d) or (h) of paragraph 3. This review may commence earlier than four years after the entry into force of this Agreement. 6. The review requested pursuant to paragraph 4 or 5 shall begin within three months of the request and be completed within six months. 7. A review on the basis of paragraphs 4 or 5 may be repeated at subsequent intervals of no less than four years after the conclusion of the previous review. If a Party has requested a review under paragraphs 4 or 5, it may not request a further review under either paragraph 4 or 5 for at least four years from the conclusion of the previous review or, if applicable, from the entry into force of any amending agreement. 8. The review shall address whether the Agreement delivers an appropriate balance of rights and obligations between the Parties, in particular with regard to the operation of Heading One [Trade], and whether, as a result, there is a need for any modification of the terms of this Agreement. 9. The Partnership Council may decide that no action is required as a result of the review. If a Party considers that following the review there is a need for an amendment of this Agreement, the Parties shall use their best endeavours to negotiate and conclude an agreement making the necessary amendments. Such negotiations shall be limited to matters identified in the review. 216

10. If an amending agreement referred to in paragraph 9 is not concluded within one year from the date the Parties started negotiations, either Party may give notice to terminate Heading One [Trade] or any other Heading of the Agreement that was added to the review, or the Parties may decide to continue negotiations. If a Party terminates Heading One [Trade], Heading Three [Road transport] shall be terminated on the same date. The termination shall take effect three months after the date of such notice. 11. If Heading One [Trade] is terminated pursuant to paragraph 10, Heading Two [Aviation] shall be terminated at the same date, unless the Parties agree to integrate the relevant parts of Title XI [Level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] in Heading Two [Aviation]. 12. Title I [Dispute settlement] of Heading Six [Dispute settlement and horizontal arrangements] does not apply to paragraphs 4 to 9. TITLE XII: EXCEPTIONS Article EXC.1: General exceptions 1. Nothing in Chapter one [National Treatment and market access for goods] and Chapter five of Title I of Heading One of Part two [Customs and trade facilitation], Title VIII of Heading One of Part two [Energy and raw materials], Chapter four of Title XI of Heading One of Part two [State-owned enterprises], Title III of Heading One of Part two [Digital trade] and Chapter two of Title II of Heading One of Part two [Investment liberalisation] shall be construed as preventing a Party from adopting or maintaining measures compatible with Article XX of GATT 1994. To that end, Article XX of GATT 1994, including its Notes and Supplementary Provisions, is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis. 2. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment liberalization or trade in services, nothing in Title VIII of Heading One of Part two [Energy and raw materials], Chapter four of Title XI of Heading One of Part two [State-owned enterprises], Title III of Heading One of Part two [Digital trade], Title II of Heading One of Part two [Services and Investment] and Title IV of Heading One of Part two [Capital movements, payments, transfers and temporary safeguard measures] shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by either Party of measures: (a) (b) (c) necessary to protect public security or public morals or to maintain public order67; necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including those relating to: (i) the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on contracts;

(c)

4. Before a Party takes any measures provided for in points (i) and (j) of Article XX of GATT 1994, that Party shall provide the other Party with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of providing the information, the Party may apply the relevant measures. Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination impossible, the Party intending to take the measures may apply forthwith precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation. That Party shall inform the other Party immediately thereof. Article EXC.2: Taxation 1. Nothing in Titles I to VII, Chapter four [Energy and raw materials] of Title VIII, Titles IX to XII of Heading One of Part Two or Heading Six [Other provisions] of Part Two shall affect the rights and obligations of either the Union or its Member States and the United Kingdom, under any tax convention. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such tax convention, the tax convention shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. With regard to a tax convention between the Union or its Member States and the United Kingdom, the relevant competent authorities under this Agreement and that tax convention shall jointly determine whether an inconsistency exists between this Agreement and the tax convention68. 2. Article SERVIN.2.4 of Chapter two of Title II of Heading One of Part two [Investment Liberalisation] and Article SERVIN.3.4 of Chapter three of Title II of Heading One of Part two [Crossborder trade in services] shall not apply to an advantage accorded pursuant to a tax convention. 3. Subject to the requirement that tax measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and investment, nothing in Titles I to VII, Chapter four [Energy and raw materials] of Title VIII, Titles IX to XII of Heading One of Part Two or Heading Six

For greater certainty, such determination shall be without prejudice to Title I of Part Six [Dispute Settlement].

[Other provisions] of Part Two shall be construed to prevent the adoption, maintenance or enforcement by a Party of any measure that: (a) (b) aims at ensuring the equitable or effective69 imposition or collection of direct taxes; or distinguishes between taxpayers, who are not in the same situation, in particular with regard to their place of residence or with regard to the place where their capital is invested. For the purposes of this Article: "residence" means residence for tax purposes; "tax convention" means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or any other international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation; and "direct taxes" comprise all taxes on income or capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, taxes on wages or salaries paid by enterprises and taxes on capital appreciation.

AIRTRN.11: Non-Discrimination 1. Without prejudice to Title XI [Level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] of Heading One, the Parties shall eliminate, within their respective jurisdictions, all forms of discrimination which would adversely affect the fair and equal opportunity of the air carriers of the other Party to compete in the exercise of the rights provided for in this Title. 2. A Party (the "initiating Party") may proceed in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 6 where it considers that its air carriers' fair and equal opportunities to compete in the exercise of the rights provided for in this Title are adversely affected by discrimination prohibited by paragraph 1. 3. The initiating Party shall submit a written request for consultations to the other Party (the "responding Party"). Consultations shall start within a period of 30 days from the receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. 4. Where the initiating Party and the responding Party fail to reach agreement on the matter within 60 days from the receipt of the request for consultations referred to in paragraph 3, the initiating Party may take measures against all or part of the air carriers which have benefitted from discrimination prohibited by paragraph 1, including action to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions of the air carriers concerned. 5. The measures taken pursuant to paragraph 4 shall be appropriate, proportionate and restricted in their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary to mitigate the injury to the air 229

Where consultations have not resolved the matter or where measures have been taken pursuant to paragraph 4, a Party may have recourse to arbitration in accordance with Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure], without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent Proceedings]. At the request of a Party, the tribunal may, pending its final ruling, order the adoption of interim relief measures, including the modification or suspension of measures taken by either Party under this Article. 7. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the Parties shall not proceed under paragraphs 3 to 6 in relation to conduct falling under the scope of Title XI [Level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] of Heading One. Article AIRTRN.12: Doing business 1. The Parties agree that obstacles to doing business encountered by air carriers would hamper the benefits under this Title. The Parties agree to cooperate in removing obstacles to doing business for air carriers of both Parties where such obstacles may hamper commercial operations, create distortions to competition or affect equal opportunities to compete. 2. The Specialised Committee on Air Transport shall monitor progress in effectively addressing matters relating to obstacles to doing business for air carriers. Article AIRTRN.13: Commercial operations 1. The Parties shall grant each other the rights laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7.

9. The relief from customs duties, national excise duties and similar national fees shall not extend to charges based on the cost of services provided to an air carrier of a Party in the territory of the other Party. Article AIRTRN.15: User charges 1. User charges that may be imposed by one Party on the air carriers of the other Party for the use of air navigation and air traffic control shall be cost-related and non-discriminatory. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carriers of the other Party on terms not less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier in like circumstances at the time the charges are applied. 2. Without prejudice to Article AIRTRN.13(5) [Commercial Operations], each Party shall ensure that user charges other than those mentioned in paragraph 1 that may be imposed on the air carriers of the other Party are just, reasonable, not unjustly discriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. User charges imposed on the air carriers of the other Party may reflect, but not exceed, the full cost of providing appropriate airport, airport environmental and aviation security facilities and services at the airport or within the airport system. Such charges may include a reasonable return on assets after depreciation. Facilities and services for which user charges are imposed shall be provided on an efficient and economic basis. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carrier of the other Party on terms no less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier in like circumstances at the time the charges are applied. 3. In order to ensure the correct application of the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, each Party shall ensure that consultations take place between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and the air carriers using the services and facilities concerned and that the competent charging authorities or bodies and the air carriers exchange such information as may be necessary. Each Party shall ensure that the competent charging authorities provide users with reasonable notice of any proposal for changes in user charges to enable users to express their views before any changes are made. Article AIRTRN.16: Tariffs 1. The Parties shall allow tariffs to be freely established by the air carriers of the Parties on the basis of fair competition in accordance with this Title. 2. The Parties shall not subject the tariffs of each other's air carriers to approval. Article AIRTRN.17: Statistics 1.

2. Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one Party and still in force shall be recognised as valid by the other Party and its competent authorities, for the purpose of operating air services under this Title, provided that such certificates or licences were issued or rendered valid pursuant to, and in conformity with, as a minimum, the relevant international standards established under the Convention. 3. Each Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained and administered by the other Party in areas relating to aeronautical facilities, flight crew, aircraft and the operation of aircraft. Such consultations shall take place within 30 days of the request. 4. If, following such consultations, one Party finds that the other Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in the areas referred to in paragraph 2 that are at least equal to the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the first Party shall notify the other Party of those findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Failure by the other Party to take appropriate action within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed shall be grounds for the requesting Party to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions, or to otherwise refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operations of the air carriers under the safety oversight of the other Party. 5. Any aircraft operated by, or under a lease arrangement on behalf of, an air carrier or air carriers of one Party may, while within the territory of the other Party, be made the subject of a ramp inspection, provided that this does not lead to unreasonable delay in the operation of the aircraft. 6. (a) The ramp inspection or series of ramp inspections can give rise to: serious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention; or serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention.

(b)

In the event that the Party that conducted the ramp inspection or inspections establishes serious concerns as referred to in point (a) or (b), it shall notify the competent authorities of the other Party that are responsible for the safety oversight of the air carrier operating the aircraft of such findings and inform them of the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards. Failure to take appropriate corrective action within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed shall constitute grounds for the first Party to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions or to otherwise refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operations of the air carrier operating the aircraft. 7. In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by the air carrier or air carriers of one Party in accordance with paragraph 5 is denied, the other Party shall be free to infer that serious concerns as referred to in paragraph 6 arise and proceed in accordance with paragraph 6. 8. Each Party reserves the right to immediately revoke, suspend or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions or to otherwise suspend or limit the operations of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Party, if the first Party concludes as a result of a ramp inspection, a series of ramp inspections, a denial of access for ramp inspection, consultation or otherwise, that immediate action is essential to the safety of an air carrier operation. The Party taking such measures shall promptly inform the other Party, providing reasons for its action. 235

9. Any action by one Party in accordance with paragraphs 4, 6 or 8 shall be discontinued once the basis for the taking of that action ceases to exist. 10. Where measures have been taken by a Party pursuant to paragraphs 4, 6 or 8, in the event of a dispute a Party may have recourse to arbitration in accordance with Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure], without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent Proceedings]. At the request of the complaining Party, the tribunal may, pending its final ruling, order the adoption of interim relief measures, including the modification or suspension of measures taken by either Party under this Article. Article AIRTRN.19: Aviation security 1. The Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to address any threat to the security of civil aviation, including the prevention of acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, of their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation. 2. The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security standards established by ICAO. They shall require that operators of the aircraft in their registries and the operators of airports in their territory, act, at least, in conformity with such aviation security standards. Each Party shall, on request, provide the other Party notification of any difference between its laws, regulations and practices and the aviation security standards referred to in this paragraph. Each Party may at any time request consultations, to be held without delay, with the other Party to discuss those differences. 3. Each Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, including, but not limited to, screening of passengers and their cabin baggage, screening of hold baggage, screening and security controls for persons other than passengers, including crew, and their items carried, screening and security controls for cargo, mail, in-flight and airport supplies, and access control to airside and security restricted areas. Each Party agrees that the security provisions of the other Party relating to the admission to, operating within, or departure from its territory of aircraft shall be observed. 4. The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on aviation security matters to the highest extent, to exchange information on threat, vulnerability and risk, subject to the mutual agreement of appropriate arrangements for the secure transfer, use, storage and disposal of classified information, to discuss and share best practices, performance and detection standards of security equipment, compliance monitoring best practices and results, and in any other area that the Parties may identify. In particular, the Parties shall endeavour to develop and maintain cooperation arrangements between technical experts on the development and recognition of aviation security standards with the aim of facilitating such cooperation, reducing administrative duplication and fostering early notice and prior discussion of new security initiatives and requirements. 5. Each Party shall make available to the other Party on request the results of audits carried out by ICAO and the corrective actions taken by the audited state, subject to the mutual agreement of appropriate arrangements for the secure transfer, use, storage and disposal of such information. 6. The Parties agree to cooperate on security inspections undertaken by them in the territory of either Party through the establishment of mechanisms, including administrative arrangements, for the reciprocal exchange of information on results of such security inspections. The Parties agree to 236

consider positively requests to participate, as observers, in security inspections undertaken by the other Party. 7. Subject to paragraph 9, and with full regard and mutual respect for the other Party's sovereignty, a Party may adopt security measures for entry into its territory. Where possible, that Party shall take into account the security measures already applied by the other Party and any views that the other Party may offer. Each Party recognises that nothing in this Article limits the right of a Party to refuse entry into its territory of any flight or flights that it deems to present a threat to its security. 8. A Party may take emergency measures to meet a specific security threat. Such measures shall be notified immediately to the other Party. Without prejudice to the need to take immediate action in order to protect aviation security, when considering security measures, a Party shall evaluate possible adverse effects on international air transport and, unless constrained by law, shall take such effects into account when it determines what measures are necessary and appropriate to address the security concerns. 9. With regard to air services bound for its territory, a Party may not require security measures to be implemented in the territory of the other Party. Where a Party considers that a specific threat urgently requires the implementation of temporary measures in addition to the measures already in place in the territory of the other Party, it shall inform the other Party of the particulars of that threat to the extent consistent with the need to protect security information, and of the proposed measures. The other Party shall give positive consideration to such a proposal and may decide to implement additional measures as it deems necessary. Such measures shall be proportionate and limited in time. 10. When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of aircraft, passengers, crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to rapidly and safely terminate such incident or threat. 11. Each Party shall take all measures it finds practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Where practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of consultations between the Parties. 12. When a Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party does not comply with this Article, that Party may request immediate consultations with the other Party. Such consultations shall start within 30 days of the receipt of such a request. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed from the date of such request shall constitute grounds for the Party that requested the consultations to take action to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisation and technical permissions of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Party to ensure compliance with this Article. When required by an emergency, or to prevent further non-compliance with this Article, a Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of the 15 day-period referred to in this paragraph. 13. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph 8 shall be discontinued when the Party in question considers that the action is no longer required or has been superseded by other measures to mitigate the threat. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph 12 shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Party with this Article. In the case of action taken in accordance with paragraph 8 or 12, this may be discontinued as mutually agreed by the Parties. 237

14. Where measures or actions have been taken in accordance with paragraphs 7, 8, 9 or 12, a Party may have recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent Proceedings]. Article AIRTRN.20: Air traffic management 1. The Parties and their respective competent authorities and air navigation service providers shall cooperate with each other in such a way as to enhance the safe and efficient functioning of air traffic in the European region. The Parties shall seek interoperability between each other's service providers. 2. The Parties agree to cooperate on matters concerning the performance and charging of air navigation services and network functions, with a view to optimising overall flight efficiency, reducing costs, minimising environmental impact and enhancing the safety and capacity of air traffic flows between the existing air traffic management systems of the Parties. 3. The Parties agree to promote cooperation between their air navigation service providers in order to exchange flight data and coordinate traffic flows to optimise flight efficiency, with a view to achieving improved predictability, punctuality and service continuity for air traffic. 4. The Parties agree to cooperate on their air traffic management modernisation programmes, including research, development and deployment activities, and to encourage cross-participation in validation and demonstration activities with the goal of ensuring global interoperability. Article AIRTRN.21: Air carrier liability The Parties reaffirm their obligations under the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, done at Montreal on 28 May 1999 (the Montreal Convention). Article AIRTRN.22: Consumer protection 1. The Parties share the objective of achieving a high level of consumer protection and shall cooperate to that effect. 2. The Parties shall ensure that effective and non-discriminatory measures are taken to protect the interests of consumers in air transport. Such measures shall include the appropriate access to information, assistance including for persons with disabilities and reduced mobility, reimbursement and, if applicable, compensation in case of denied boarding, cancellation or delays, and efficient complaint handling procedures. 3. The Parties shall consult each other on any matter related to consumer protection, including their planned measures in that regard. Article AIRTRN.23: Relationship to other agreements 1. Earlier agreements and arrangements relating to the subject matter of this Title between the United Kingdom and the Member States, to the extent that they may not have been superseded by the law of the Union, shall be superseded by this Agreement.

If the Parties become party to a multilateral agreement, or endorse a decision adopted by ICAO or another international organisation that addresses matters covered by this Title, they shall consult in the Specialised Committee on Air Transport to determine whether this Title should be revised to take into account such developments. 4. Nothing in this Title shall affect the validity and application of existing and future agreements between the Member States and the United Kingdom as regards territories under their respective sovereignty which are not covered by Article FINPROV.1 [Territorial scope]. 5. Nothing in this Title shall affect any rights available to the United Kingdom and Member States under the Multilateral Agreement on Commercial Rights of Non-Scheduled Air Services in Europe, signed at Paris on 30 April 1956, to the extent that such rights go beyond those laid down in this Title. Article AIRTRN.24: Suspension and Termination 1.

The authorising authority shall forward to such competent authorities, as well as to the competent authorities whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down, a copy of the application, together with copies of any other relevant documentation, and its assessment. In respect of the Union, the competent authorities referred to in the first part of this paragraph shall be those of the Member States in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down and whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down. 2. The competent authorities whose agreement has been requested shall notify the authorising authority of their decision regarding the application within four months. This time limit shall be calculated from the date of receipt of the request for agreement which is shown in the acknowledgement of receipt. If the decision received from the competent authorities whose agreement has been requested is negative, it shall contain a proper statement of reasons. If the authorising authority does not receive a reply within four months, the competent authorities consulted shall be deemed to have given their agreement and the authorising authority may grant the authorisation. The competent authorities whose territory is crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may notify the authorising authority of their comments within four months. 3. In respect of services that had been authorised under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and Council70 before the end of the transition period and in respect of which the authorisation lapses at the end of the transition period, the following shall apply: (a) where, subject to the changes necessary to comply with Article X+2, the operating conditions are the same as those having been set in the authorisation granted under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, the relevant authorising authority under this Title may, on application or otherwise, issue the road transport operator with a corresponding authorisation granted under this Title. Where such an authorisation is issued, the agreement of the competent authorities in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down, as referred to in paragraph 2, shall be deemed

to be provided. Those competent authorities and the competent authorities whose territory is crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may, at any time, notify the authorising authority of any comments they may have; (b) where point (a) is applied, the validity period of the corresponding authorisation granted under this Title shall not extend beyond the last day of the validity period specified in the authorisation previously granted under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009.

4. The authorising authority shall take a decision on the application no later than six months from the date of submission of the application by the road passenger transport operator. 5. (a) Authorisation shall be granted unless: the applicant is unable to provide the service which is the subject of the application with equipment directly available to the applicant; the applicant has not complied with national or international legislation on road transport, and in particular the conditions and requirements relating to authorisations for international road passenger services, or has committed serious infringements of a Party's road transport legislation in particular with regard to the rules applicable to vehicles and driving and rest periods for drivers; in the case of an application for renewal of authorisation, the conditions of authorisation have not been complied with; a Party decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the service concerned would seriously affect the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts conforming to the Party's law on the direct sections concerned. In such a case, the Party shall set up criteria, on a non-discriminatory basis, for determining whether the service applied for would seriously affect the viability of the abovementioned comparable service and shall communicate them to the other Party referred to in paragraph 1; or a Party decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the principal purpose of the service is not to carry passengers between stops located in the territories of the Parties. In the event that an existing service seriously affects the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts which conform to a Party's law on the direct sections concerned, due to exceptional reasons which could not have been foreseen at the time of granting the authorisation, a Party may, with the agreement of the other Party, suspend or withdraw the authorisation to run the international coach and bus service after having given six months' notice to the road passenger transport operator . The fact that a road passenger transport operator of a Party offers lower prices than those offered by other road passenger transport operators or the fact that the link in question is already operated by other road passenger transport operators shall not in itself constitute justification for rejecting the application. 6. Having completed the procedure laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5, the authorising authority shall grant the authorisation or formally refuse the application.

In the event of a minor alteration to the operating conditions, in particular the adjustment of intervals, fares and timetables, the authorising authority needs only supply the competent authorities of the other Party with information relating to the alteration. Changing the timetables or intervals in a manner that affects the timing of controls at the borders between the Parties or at third country borders shall not be considered a minor alteration. Article X+8: Lapse of an authorisation 1. Without prejudice to Article X+6(3), an authorisation for a service referred to in Article X+2 shall lapse at the end of its period of validity or three months after the authorising authority has received notice from its holder of his or her intention to withdraw the service. Such notice shall contain a proper statement of reasons. 2. Where demand for a service has ceased to exist, the period of notice provided for in paragraph 1 shall be one month. 3. The authorising authority shall inform the competent authorities of the other Party concerned that the authorisation has lapsed. 4. The holder of the authorisation shall notify users of the service concerned of its withdrawal one month in advance by means of appropriate publicity. Article X+9: Obligations of transport operators 1. Save in the event of force majeure, the road passenger transport operator of a Party carrying out a service referred to in Article X+2 shall launch the service without delay and, until the authorisation expires, take all measures to guarantee a transport service that fulfils the standards of continuity, regularity and capacity and complies with the conditions specified in accordance with Article X+4(6) and Annex ROAD-2. 2. The road passenger transport operator of a Party shall display the route of the service, the bus stops, the timetable, the fares and the conditions of carriage in such a way as to ensure that such information is readily available to all users.

Without prejudice to Article X+4(8), the authorisation or a certified true copy thereof to carry out services referred to in Article X+2 and the operator's licence of the road passenger transport operator or a certified true copy thereof for the international carriage of passengers by road provided for according to national or Union law shall be kept on the coach or bus and shall be presented at the request of any authorised inspecting officer. 2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 as well as to Article X+4(8), in the case of a special regular service, the contract between the organiser and the road passenger transport operator or a copy thereof as well as a document evidencing that the passengers constitute a specific category to the exclusion of other passengers for the purposes of a special regular service shall also serve as control documents, shall be kept in the vehicle and shall be presented at the request of any authorised inspecting officer. 3. Road passenger transport operators carrying out occasional services under Article X+2(6) and (7) shall carry a completed journey form, using the model in Annex ROAD-4. Books of journey forms shall be supplied by the competent authority of the territory in which the operator is registered, or by bodies appointed by the competent authority. Article X+11: Road traffic rules Drivers of coaches and buses undertaking the transport of passengers under this Title shall, when in the territory of the other Party, comply with the national laws and regulations in force in that territory concerning road traffic.

2. If a stock listed in Annex FISH.1 or Annex FISH.2A and B remains without an agreed TAC on 20 December, each Party shall set a provisional TAC corresponding to the level advised by ICES, applying from 1 January. 3.

3. The Parties shall conduct the annual consultations, including on the level and conditions of access referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in good faith and with the objective of ensuring a mutually satisfactory balance between the interests of both Parties. 4. (a) In particular, the outcome of the consultations should normally result in each Party granting: access to fish the stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 and Annex FISH.2.A, B and F in each other's EEZ (or if access is granted under point (c), in EEZs and in the divisions mentioned in that point) at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the Parties' respective shares of the TACs; access to fish non-quota stocks in each other's EEZ (or if access is granted under point (c), in EEZs and in the divisions mentioned in that point), at a level that at least equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016; and access to the waters of the Parties between six and twelve nautical miles from the baseline in ICES divisions 4c and 7d-g for qualifying vessels to the extent that Union fishing vessels and United Kingdom fishing vessels had access to those waters on 31 December 2020. For the purposes of point (c), `qualifying vessel' means a vessel of a Party which fished in the zone mentioned in the previous sentence in four of the years between 2012 and 2016, or its direct replacement. Annual consultations referred to in point (c) may include appropriate financial commitments and quota transfers between the Parties. 5. During the application of a provisional TAC, and pending an agreed TAC, the Parties shall grant provisional access to fish in the relevant ICES sub-areas as follows (a) for stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 and non-quota stocks, from 1 January until 31 March at the levels provided for in paragraph 4(a) and (b); (b) for stocks listed in Annex FISH.2 from 1 January until 14 February at the levels provided for in paragraph 4(a); and (c) in relation to access to fish in the six to twelve nautical miles zone, access in accordance with paragraph 4(c) from 1 January to 31 January at a level equivalent to the average monthly tonnage fished in that zone in the previous 3 months. Such access, for each of the relevant stocks in points (a) and (b), shall be in proportion to the average percentage of a Party's share of the annual TAC which that Party's vessels fished in the other Party's waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas during the same period of the previous three calendar years. The same shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to access to fish non-quota stocks. By 15 January in relation to the situation in point (c) of this paragraph, by 31 January in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2, and by 15 March in respect of all other stocks, each Party shall notify the other Party of the change in the level and conditions of access to waters that will apply as of 1 February in relation to the situation in point (c), as of 15 February in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2, and as of 1 April in respect of all other stocks for the relevant ICES sub-areas. 6. Without prejudice to Article FISH.7(1) and (8)[Provisional TACs], after the period of one month in relation to the situation in point (c) of paragraph 5, one and a half months in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2 and three months in respect of all other stocks, the Parties shall seek to agree 266

further provisional access arrangements at the appropriate geographical level with the aim of minimising disruption to fishing activities.

7. In granting access under paragraph 1, a Party may take into account compliance of individual or groups of vessels with the applicable rules in its waters during the preceding year, and measures taken by the other Party pursuant to Article FISH.5(2) [Authorisations, compliance and enforcement] during the preceding year. 8. This Article shall apply subject to Annex FISH.4 [Protocol on access to waters]. Article FISH.9: Compensatory measures in case of withdrawal or reduction of access 1. Following a notification by a Party ("host Party") under Article FISH.8(5)[Access to waters], the other Party ("fishing Party") may take compensatory measures commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the change in the level and conditions of access to waters. Such impact shall be measured on the basis of reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture and remote possibility. Giving priority to those compensatory measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement, the fishing Party may suspend, in whole or in part, access to its waters and the preferential tariff treatment granted to fishery products under Article GOODS.5[Prohibition and customs duties]. 2. A compensatory measure referred to in paragraph 1 may take effect at the earliest seven days after the fishing Party has given notice to the host Party of the intended suspension under paragraph 1 and, in any case, not earlier than 1 February in relation to the situation in point (c) of Article 8(5)[Access to waters], 15 February in respect of Annex FISH.2 and 1 April in respect of other stocks. The Parties shall consult within the Specialised Committee with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable solution. That notification shall identify: (a) (b) the date upon which the fishing Party intends to suspend; and the obligations to be suspended and the level of the intended suspension.

3. After the notification of the compensatory measures in accordance with paragraph 2, the host Party may request the establishment of an arbitration tribunal pursuant to Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure] of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six, without having recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. The arbitration tribunal may only review the conformity of the compensatory measures with paragraph 1. The arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent proceedings] of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six. 4. When the conditions for taking compensatory measures referred to in paragraph 1 are no longer met, such measures shall be withdrawn immediately. 5. Following a finding against the fishing Party in the procedure referred to in paragraph 3, the host Party may request the arbitration tribunal, within 30 days from its ruling, to determine a level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement not exceeding the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the application of the compensatory measures, if it finds that the inconsistency of the compensatory measures with paragraph 1 is significant. The request shall propose a level of suspension in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 1 and any relevant principles set out in Article INST.34C [Suspension of obligations for the purposes of LPFS.3.12(12), Article FISH.9(5) and Article FISH.14(7)]. The host Party may apply the level of suspension of 267
24.12.2020

obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the level of suspension determined by the arbitration tribunal, no sooner than 15 days following such ruling.

6. A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from suspending obligations under this Article. Article FISH.10: Access to waters of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Isle of Man 1.

Immediately after having been informed about the request, the issuing authority shall provide the copy of the judgment via the executing authority to the person concerned. The request of the person concerned shall neither delay the surrender procedure nor delay the decision to execute the arrest warrant. The provision of the judgment to the person concerned shall be for information purposes only; it shall not be regarded as a formal service of the judgment nor actuate any time limits applicable for requesting a retrial or appeal. 3. Where a person is surrendered under the conditions in point (i) (iv) of paragraph 1 and that person has requested a retrial or appeal, until those proceedings are finalised the detention of that person awaiting such retrial or appeal shall be reviewed in accordance with the domestic law of the issuing State, either on a regular basis or upon request of the person concerned. Such a review shall in particular include the possibility of suspension or interruption of the detention. The retrial or appeal shall begin within due time after the surrender.

The notification shall be based on reasons related to the fundamental principles or practice of the domestic legal order of the United Kingdom or the State on behalf of which a notification was made. In such a case, the Union, on behalf of any of its Member States or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation within a reasonable time after the receipt of the other Party's notification that the executing judicial authorities of the Member State or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may refuse to surrender its nationals to that State or that surrender shall be authorised only under certain specified conditions. 3. In circumstances where a State has refused to execute an arrest warrant on the basis that, in the case of the United Kingdom, it has made a notification or, in the case of a Member State, the Union has made a notification on its behalf, as referred to in paragraph 2, that State shall consider instituting proceedings against its own national which are commensurate with the subject matter of the arrest warrant, having taken into account the views of the issuing State. In circumstances where a judicial authority decides not to institute such proceedings, the victim of the offence on which the arrest warrant is based shall be able to receive information on the decision in accordance with the applicable domestic law. 4. Where a State's competent authorities institute proceedings against its own national in accordance with paragraph 3, that State shall ensure that its competent authorities are able to take appropriate measures to assist the victims and witnesses in circumstances where they are residents of another State, particularly with regard to the way in which the proceedings are conducted.

Article LAW.SURR.99: Competing international obligations 1. This Agreement does not prejudice the obligations of the executing State where the requested person has been extradited to that State from a third country and where that person is protected by provisions of the arrangement under which that person was extradited concerning the speciality rule. The executing State shall take all necessary measures for requesting without delay the consent of the third country from which the requested person was extradited so that the requested person can be surrendered to the State which issued the arrest warrant. The time limits referred to in Article LAW.SURR.95 [Time limits and procedures for the decision to execute the arrest warrant] do not start running until the day on which the speciality rule ceases to apply. 2.

In that event, the surrender shall take place within ten days of the new date thus agreed. 4. The surrender may exceptionally be temporarily postponed for serious humanitarian reasons, for example if there are substantial grounds for believing that the surrender would manifestly endanger the requested person's life or health. The execution of the arrest warrant shall take place as soon as those grounds have ceased to exist. The executing judicial authority shall immediately inform the issuing judicial authority and agree on a new surrender date. In that event, the surrender shall take place within ten days of the new date - agreed. 5. Upon the expiry of the time limits referred to in paragraphs 2 to 4, if the requested person is still being held in custody, that person shall be released.

Article LAW.SURR.102: Postponed or conditional surrender 1. After deciding to execute the arrest warrant, the executing judicial authority may postpone the surrender of the requested person so that the requested person may be prosecuted in the executing State or, if the requested person has already been sentenced, so that the requested person may serve, a sentence passed for an act other than that referred to in the arrest warrant in the territory of the executing State. 2. Instead of postponing the surrender, the executing judicial authority may temporarily surrender the requested person to the issuing State under conditions to be determined by mutual agreement between the executing and the issuing judicial authorities. The agreement shall be made in writing and the conditions shall be binding on all the authorities in the issuing State. Article LAW.SURR.103: Transit 1. Each State shall permit the transit through its territory of a requested person who is being surrendered provided that it has been given information on: (a) (b) (c) (d) the identity and nationality of the person subject to the arrest warrant; the existence of an arrest warrant; the nature and legal classification of the offence; and the description of the circumstances of the offence, including the date and place.

2. The State, on behalf of which a notification has been made in accordance with Article LAW.SURR.83(2) [Nationality exception] to the effect that its own nationals will not be surrendered or that surrender will be authorised only under certain specified conditions, may refuse the transit of its own nationals through its territory under the same terms or submit it to the same conditions. 3. The States shall designate an authority responsible for receiving transit requests and the necessary documents, as well as any other official correspondence relating to transit requests. 4. The transit request and the information referred to in paragraph 1 may be addressed to the authority designated pursuant to paragraph 3 by any means capable of producing a written record. The State of transit shall notify its decision by the same procedure. 5. This Article does not apply in the case of transport by air without a scheduled stopover. However, if an unscheduled landing occurs, the issuing State shall provide the authority designated pursuant to paragraph 3 with the information referred to in paragraph 1. 6.

If the competent authority of the requested State decides to have recourse to a measure other than that indicated in the request for mutual assistance as referred to in paragraphs 1 or 3, it shall first inform the competent authority of the requesting State, which may decide to withdraw or supplement the request. 5. If the investigative measure indicated in the request does not exist under the law of the requested State or would not be available in a similar domestic case, and there is no other investigative measure which would have the same result as the investigative measure requested, the competent authority of the requested State shall inform the competent authority of the requesting State that it is not possible to provide the assistance requested. Article LAW.MUTAS.118: Obligation to inform The competent authority of the requested State shall inform the competent authority of the requesting State by any means and without undue delay if: (a) it is impossible to execute the request for mutual assistance due to the fact that the request is incomplete or manifestly incorrect; or the competent authority of the requested State, in the course of the execution of the request for mutual assistance, considers without further enquiries that it may be appropriate to carry out investigative measures not initially foreseen, or which could not be specified when the request for mutual assistance was made, in order to enable the competent authority of the requesting State to take further action in the specific case.

If a request for mutual assistance is made to take provisional measures pursuant to Article 24 of the Second Additional Protocol to the European Mutual Assistance Convention, the competent authority of the requested State shall decide on the provisional measure, and shall communicate that decision to the competent authority of the requesting State, as soon as possible after the receipt of the request. Before lifting any provisional measure taken pursuant to this Article, the competent authority of the requested State, wherever possible, shall give the competent authority of the requesting State an opportunity to present its reasons in favour of continuing the measure. 5. If in a specific case, the time limit provided for in paragraph 1 or 2, or the time limit or specific date referred to in paragraph 3 cannot be met, or the decision on taking provisional measures in accordance with paragraph 4 is delayed, the competent authority of the requested State shall, without delay, inform the competent authority of the requesting State by any means, giving the reasons for the delay, and shall consult with the competent authority of the requesting State on the appropriate timing to execute the request for mutual assistance. 6.

Where the request concerning one of these measures specifies formalities or procedures which are necessary under the domestic law of the requesting State, even if unfamiliar to the requested State, the latter shall comply with such requests to the extent that the action sought is not contrary to the fundamental principles of its domestic law. 4. The requested State shall ensure that the requests coming from another State to identify, trace, freeze or seize the proceeds and instrumentalities, receive the same priority as those made in the framework of domestic procedures. 5. When requesting confiscation, investigative assistance and provisional measures for the purposes of confiscation, the requesting State shall ensure that the principles of necessity and proportionality are respected. 6.

The decision to monitor shall be taken in each individual case by the competent authorities of the requested State, in accordance with its domestic law. 4. The practical details regarding the monitoring shall be agreed between the competent authorities of the requesting and requested States. 5. The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that this Article will be extended to accounts held in non-bank financial institutions.

Article LAW.CONFISC.7: Spontaneous information Without prejudice to its own investigations or proceedings, a State may without prior request forward to another State information on instrumentalities, proceeds and other property liable to confiscation, where it considers that the disclosure of such information might assist the receiving State in initiating or carrying out investigations or proceedings or might lead to a request by that State under this Title. Article LAW.CONFISC.8: Obligation to take provisional measures 1. At the request of another State which has instituted a criminal investigation or proceedings, or an investigation or proceedings for the purposes of confiscation, the requested State shall take the necessary provisional measures, such as freezing or seizing, to prevent any dealing in, transfer or disposal of property which, at a later stage, may be the subject of a request for confiscation or which might satisfy the request. 2. A State which has received a request for confiscation pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] shall, if so requested, take the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in respect of any property which is the subject of the request or which might satisfy the request. 3.

Where the requesting State states that immediate freezing is necessary since there are legitimate grounds to believe that the property in question will immediately be removed or destroyed, the requested State shall take all necessary measures to comply with the request within 96 hours of receiving the request and send confirmation to the requesting State by any means of producing a written record and without delay. 342

5. Where the requested State is unable to comply with the time limits under paragraph 4, the requested State shall immediately inform the requesting State, and consult with the requesting State on the appropriate next steps. 6. Any expiration of the time limits under paragraph 4 does not extinguish the requirements placed on the requested State by this Article. Article LAW.CONFISC.9: Execution of provisional measures 1. After the execution of the provisional measures requested in conformity with Article LAW.CONFISC.8(1) [Obligation to take provisional measures], the requesting State shall provide spontaneously and as soon as possible to the requested State all information which may question or modify the extent of those measures. The requesting State shall also provide without delay all complementary information required by the requested State and which is necessary for the implementation of and the follow-up to the provisional measures. 2. Before lifting any provisional measure taken pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures], the requested State shall, wherever possible, give the requesting State an opportunity to present its reasons in favour of continuing the measure. Article LAW.CONFISC.10: Obligation to confiscate 1. shall: (a) The State which has received a request for confiscation of property situated in its territory

enforce a confiscation order made by a court of the requesting State in relation to such property; or submit the request to its competent authorities for the purpose of obtaining an order of confiscation and, if such an order is granted, enforce it.

(b)

2. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, the States shall, whenever necessary, have competence to institute confiscation proceedings under their own domestic law. 3. Paragraph 1 also applies to confiscation consisting in a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of proceeds, if property against which the confiscation can be enforced is located in the requested State. In such cases, when enforcing confiscation pursuant to paragraph 1, the requested State shall, if payment is not obtained, realise the claim on any property available for that purpose. 4. If a request for confiscation concerns a specific item of property, the requesting State and requested State may agree that the requested State may enforce the confiscation in the form of a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of the property. 5. A State shall cooperate to the widest extent possible under its domestic law with a State requesting the execution of measures equivalent to confiscation of property, where the request has not been issued in the framework of proceedings in criminal matters, in so far as such measures are ordered by a judicial authority of the requesting State in relation to a criminal offence, provided that it has been established that the property constitutes proceeds or: (a) other property into which the proceeds have been transformed or converted; 343

(b)

property acquired from legitimate sources, if proceeds have been intermingled, in whole or in part, with such property, up to the assessed value of the intermingled proceeds; or income or other benefit derived from the proceeds, from property into which proceeds of crime have been transformed or converted or from property with which the proceeds of crime have been intermingled, up to the assessed value of the intermingled proceeds, in the same manner and to the same extent as proceeds.

(c)

6. The measures referred to in paragraph 5 include measures which allow the seizure, detention and forfeiture of property and assets by means of applications to civil courts. 7. The requested State shall take the decision on the execution of the confiscation order without delay, and, without prejudice to paragraph 8 of this Article, no later than 45 days after receiving the request. The requested State shall send confirmation to the requesting State by any means of producing a written record and without delay. Unless grounds for postponement under Article LAW.CONFISC.17 [Postponement] exist, the requested State shall take the concrete measures necessary to execute the confiscation order without delay and, at least, with the same speed and priority as for a similar domestic case. 8. Where the requested State is unable to comply with the time limit under paragraph 7, the requested State shall immediately inform the requesting State, and consult with the requesting State on the appropriate next steps. 9. Any expiration of the time limit under paragraph 7 does not extinguish the requirements placed on the requested State by this Article. Article LAW.CONFISC.11: Execution of confiscation 1. The procedures for obtaining and enforcing the confiscation under Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] shall be governed by the domestic law of the requested State. 2. The requested State shall be bound by the findings as to the facts in so far as they are stated in a conviction or judicial decision issued by a court of the requesting State or in so far as such conviction or judicial decision is implicitly based on them. 3. If the confiscation consists in the requirement to pay a sum of money, the competent authority of the requested State shall convert the amount thereof into the currency of that State at the rate of exchange applicable at the time when the decision to enforce the confiscation is taken. Article LAW.CONFISC.12: Confiscated property 1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, property confiscated pursuant to Articles LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] and LAW.CONFISC.11 [Execution of confiscation] shall be disposed of by the requested State in accordance with its domestic law and administrative procedures. 2. When acting on the request made by another State pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate], the requested State shall, to the extent permitted by its domestic law and if so requested, give priority consideration to returning the confiscated property to the requesting State so that it can give compensation to the victims of the crime or return such property to their legitimate owners.

3. Where acting on the request made by another State in accordance with Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate], and after having taken into account the right of a victim to restitution or compensation of property pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, the requested State shall dispose of the money obtained as a result of the execution of a confiscation order as follows: (a) if the amount is equal to or less than EUR 10 000, the amount shall accrue to the requested State; or if the amount is greater than EUR 10 000, the requested State shall transfer 50 % of the amount recovered to the requesting State.

(b)

4. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, the requesting State and requested State may, on a case-bycase basis, give special consideration to concluding other such agreements or arrangements on disposal of property as they deem appropriate. Article LAW.CONFISC.13: Right of enforcement and maximum amount of confiscation 1. A request for confiscation made under Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] does not affect the right of the requesting State to enforce the confiscation order itself. 2. Nothing in this Title shall be interpreted as permitting the total value of the confiscation to exceed the amount of the sum of money specified in the confiscation order. If a State finds that this might occur, the States concerned shall enter into consultations to avoid such an effect. Article LAW.CONFISC.14: Imprisonment in default The requested State shall not impose imprisonment in default or any other measure restricting the liberty of a person as a result of a request under Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] without the consent of the requesting State. Article LAW.CONFISC.15: Grounds for refusal 1. (a) Cooperation under this Title may be refused if: the requested State considers that executing the request would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem; or the offence to which the request relates does not constitute an offence under the domestic law of the requested State if committed within its jurisdiction; however, this ground for refusal applies to cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information] only in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action.

(b)

2. The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that, on the basis of reciprocity, the condition of double criminality referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article will not be applied provided that the offence giving rise to the request is: (a) one of the offences listed in Article LAW.SURR.79(4) [Scope], as defined by the law of the requesting State; and punishable by the requesting State by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years. 345

3. Cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information], in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Articles LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures] and LAW.CONFISC.9 [Execution of provisional measures] may also be refused if the measures sought could not be taken under the domestic law of the requested State for the purposes of investigations or proceedings in a similar domestic case. 4. Where the domestic law of the requested State so requires, cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information], in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Articles LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures] and LAW.CONFISC.9 [Execution of provisional measures] may also be refused if the measures sought or any other measures having similar effects would not be permitted under the domestic law of the requesting State, or, as regards the competent authorities of the requesting State, if the request is not authorised by a judicial authority acting in relation to criminal offences. 5. Cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] to LAW.CONFISC.14 [Imprisonment in default] may also be refused if: (a) under the domestic law of the requested State, confiscation is not provided for in respect of the type of offence to which the request relates; without prejudice to the obligation pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10(3) [Obligation to confiscate], it would be contrary to the principles of the domestic law of the requested State concerning the limits of confiscation in respect of the relationship between an offence and: (i) (ii) (c) an economic advantage that might be qualified as its proceeds; or property that might be qualified as its instrumentalities;

(b)

under the domestic law of the requested State, confiscation may no longer be imposed or enforced because of the lapse of time; without prejudice to Article LAW.CONFISC.10 (5) and (6) [Obligation to confiscate], the request does not relate to a previous conviction, or a decision of a judicial nature or a statement in such a decision that an offence or several offences have been committed, on the basis of which the confiscation has been ordered or is sought; confiscation is either not enforceable in the requesting State, or it is still subject to ordinary means of appeal; or the request relates to a confiscation order resulting from a decision rendered in absentia of the person against whom the order was issued and, in the opinion of the requested State, the proceedings conducted by the requesting State leading to such decision did not satisfy the minimum rights of defence recognised as due to everyone against whom a criminal charge is made.

(d)

(e)

(f)

6. For the purposes of point (f) of paragraph 5 a decision is not considered to have been rendered in absentia if: (a) (b) it has been confirmed or pronounced after opposition by the person concerned; or it has been rendered on appeal, provided that the appeal was lodged by the person concerned. 346

7. When considering, for the purposes of point (f) of paragraph 5, whether the minimum rights of defence have been satisfied, the requested State shall take into account the fact that the person concerned has deliberately sought to evade justice or the fact that that person, having had the possibility of lodging a legal remedy against the decision made in absentia, elected not to do so. The same applies where the person concerned, having been duly served with the summons to appear, elected not to do so nor to ask for adjournment. 8. The States shall not invoke bank secrecy as a ground to refuse any cooperation under this Title. Where its domestic law so requires, a requested State may require that a request for cooperation which would involve the lifting of bank secrecy be authorised by a judicial authority acting in relation to criminal offences. 9. (a) The requested State shall not invoke the fact that: the person under investigation or subject to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting State is a legal person as an obstacle to affording any cooperation under this Title; the natural person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has died or a legal person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has subsequently been dissolved as an obstacle to affording assistance in accordance with point (a) of Article LAW.CONFISC.10(1) [Obligation to confiscate]; or the person under investigation or subject to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting State is mentioned in the request both as the author of the underlying criminal offence and of the offence of money laundering as an obstacle to affording any cooperation under this Title. Article LAW.CONFISC.16: Consultation and information Where there are substantial grounds for believing that the execution of a freezing or confiscation order would entail a real risk for the protection of fundamental rights, the requested State shall, before it decides on the execution of the freezing or confiscation order, consult the requesting State and may require any necessary information to be provided. Article LAW.CONFISC.17: Postponement The requested State may postpone action on a request if such action would prejudice investigations or proceedings by its authorities. Article LAW.CONFISC.18: Partial or conditional granting of a request Before refusing or postponing cooperation under this Title, the requested State shall, where appropriate after having consulted the requesting State, consider whether the request may be granted partially or subject to such conditions as it deems necessary. Article LAW.CONFISC.19: Notification of documents 1. The States shall afford each other the widest measure of mutual assistance in the serving of judicial documents to persons affected by provisional measures and confiscation. 2. Nothing in this Article is intended to interfere with: 347

(b)

3. When serving judicial documents to persons abroad affected by provisional measures or confiscation orders issued in the sending State, that State shall indicate what legal remedies are available under its domestic law to such persons. Article LAW.CONFISC.20: Recognition of foreign decisions 1. When dealing with a request for cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures] to LAW.CONFISC.14 [Imprisonment in default] the requested State shall recognise any decision issued by a judicial authority taken in the requesting State regarding rights claimed by third parties. 2. (a) (b) Recognition may be refused if: third parties did not have adequate opportunity to assert their rights; the decision is incompatible with a decision already taken in the requested State on the same matter; it is incompatible with the ordre public of the requested State; or the decision was taken contrary to provisions on exclusive jurisdiction provided for by the domestic law of the requested State. Article LAW.CONFISC.21: Authorities 1. Each State shall designate a central authority to be responsible for sending and answering requests made under this Title, the execution of such requests or their transmission to the authorities competent for their execution. 2. The Union may designate a Union body which may, in addition to the competent authorities of the Member States, make and, if appropriate, execute requests under this Title. Any such request is to be treated for the purposes of this Title as a request by a Member State. The Union may also designate that Union body as the central authority responsible for the purpose of sending and answering requests made under this Title by, or to, that body. Article LAW.CONFISC.22: Direct communication 1. The central authorities shall communicate directly with one another.

Requests or communications under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information], which do not involve coercive action, may be directly transmitted by the competent authorities of the requesting State to the competent authorities of the requested State. 5. Draft requests or communications under this Title may be sent directly by the judicial authorities of the requesting State to the judicial authorities of the requested State prior to a formal request to ensure that the formal request can be dealt with efficiently upon receipt and that it contains sufficient information and supporting documentation for it to meet the requirements of the law of the requested State. Article LAW.CONFISC.23: Form of request and languages 1. All requests under this Title shall be made in writing. They may be transmitted electronically, or by any other means of telecommunication, provided that the requesting State is prepared, upon request, to produce a written record of such communication and the original at any time. 2.

If external assigned revenue appropriations that do not result from financial contributions to Union programmes and activities from other donors as defined in Protocol I are cancelled, the contribution of the United Kingdom shall be reduced by the amount obtained by applying the contribution key of year N to the amount cancelled. In year N+2 or in subsequent years, after having made the adjustments referred to in the second, third and fourth subparagraphs, the contribution of the United Kingdom for year N shall also be reduced by an amount obtained by multiplying the contribution of the United Kingdom for year N and the ratio of: (a) the legal commitments of year N, funded under any commitment appropriations available in year N, and resulting from competitive award procedures, (i) from which the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom entities have been excluded, or for which the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes has decided, in accordance with the procedure established in Article UNPRO.2.1a [Quasiexclusion from competitive grant award procedure] that there has been a quasiexclusion of United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities, or for which the deadline for submission of applications has expired during the suspension referred to in Article UNPRO.3.1 [Suspension of the participation of the United Kingdom in a Union programme by the European Union] or after termination referred to in Article UNPRO.3.3 [Termination of the participation in a programme in the case of substantial modification of Union programme] has taken effect, or for which the participation of the United Kingdom and United Kingdom entities has been limited in accordance with Article UNPRO.3.5(3) [Financial increases review]; and

Detailed rules on the identification of the parts of the programme or activity to which the automatic correction mechanism does or does not apply may be established in Protocol I. 2. The amount of the automatic correction for a programme or activity or parts thereof shall be the difference between the initial amounts of the legal commitments actually entered into with the United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities financed from commitment appropriations of the year in question and the corresponding operational contribution paid by the United Kingdom as adjusted pursuant to Article UNPRO.2.1(8) [Financial conditions], excluding support expenditure, covering the same period if that amount is positive.

If immediate compliance is not possible, the respondent Party, no later than 30 days after delivery of the ruling referred to in Article INST.20(1) [Ruling of the arbitration tribunal], shall deliver a notification to the complaining Party of the length of the reasonable period of time it will require for compliance with the ruling referred to in Article INST.20(1) [Ruling of the arbitration tribunal]. The Parties shall endeavour to agree on the length of the reasonable period of time to comply. 2. If the Parties have not agreed on the length of the reasonable period of time, the complaining Party may, at the earliest 20 days after the delivery of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, request in writing that the original arbitration tribunal determines the length of the reasonable period of time.

The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its decision to the Parties within 45 days of the date of delivery of the request. Article INST.24: Temporary Remedies 1. The respondent Party shall, at the request of and after consultations with the complaining Party, present an offer for temporary compensation if: (a) the respondent Party delivers a notification to the complaining Party that it is not possible to comply with the ruling referred to in Article INST.20(1) [Ruling of the arbitration tribunal]; or

(b) the respondent Party fails to deliver a notification of any measure taken to comply within the deadline referred to in Article INST.21 [Compliance Measures] or before the date of expiry of the reasonable period of time; or (c) the arbitration tribunal finds that no measure taken to comply exists or that the measure taken to comply is inconsistent with the covered provisions. 2. In any of the conditions referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1, the complaining Party may deliver a written notification to the respondent Party that it intends to suspend the application of obligations under the covered provisions if: (a) the complaining Party decides not to make a request under paragraph 1; or

(b) the Parties do not agree on the temporary compensation within 20 days after the expiry of the reasonable period of time or the delivery of the arbitration tribunal decision under Article INST.23 [Compliance Review] if a request under paragraph 1 is made. The notification shall specify the level of intended suspension of obligations. 3. Suspension of obligations shall be subject to the following conditions: (a) Obligations under Heading Four [Social security coordination and visas for short-term visits]of Part Two, the Protocol on Social Security Coordination or its annexes or Part Five [Union programmes] may not be suspended under this Article; (b) By derogation from point (a), obligations under Part Five [Union programmes] may be suspended only where the ruling referred to in Article INST.20(1) [Ruling of the arbitration tribunal] concerns the interpretation and implementation of Part Five [Union programmes]; (c) Obligations outside Part Five [Union programmes] may not be suspended where the ruling referred to in Article INST.20(1) [Ruling of the arbitration tribunal] concerns the interpretation and implementation of Part Five [Union programmes]; and (d) Obligations under Title II [Services and Investment] of Heading One of Part Two in respect of financial services may not be suspended under this Article, unless the ruling referred to in Article INST.20(1) [Ruling of the arbitration tribunal] concerns the interpretation and application of obligations under Title II [Services and Investment] of Heading One of Part Two in respect of financial services. 4. Where a Party persists in not complying with a ruling of an arbitration panel established under an earlier agreement concluded between the Parties, the other Party may suspend obligations under the covered provisions referred to in Article INST.10 [Scope]. With the exception of the rule in point (a) of paragraph 3, all rules relating to temporary remedies in case of non-compliance and to review of any such measures shall be governed by the earlier agreement. 5. The suspension of obligations shall not exceed the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation. 6. If the arbitration tribunal has found the violation in Heading One [Trade] or Heading Three [Road] of Part Two, the suspension may be applied in another Title of the same Heading as that in 390

which the tribunal has found the violation, in particular if the complaining party is of the view that such suspension is effective in inducing compliance. 7. If the arbitration tribunal has found the violation in Heading Two [Aviation]:

(a) the complaining party should first seek to suspend obligations in the same Title as that in which the arbitration tribunal has found the violation; (b) if the complaining party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend obligations with respect to the same Title as that in which the tribunal has found the violation, it may seek to suspend obligations in the other Title under the same Heading. 8. If the arbitration tribunal has found the violation in Heading One [Trade], Heading Two [Aviation], Heading Three [Road] or Heading Five [Fisheries] of Part Two, and if the complaining party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend obligations within the same Heading as that in which the arbitration tribunal has found the violation, and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may seek to suspend obligations under other covered provisions. 9. In the case of point (b) of paragraph 7 and paragraph 8, the complaining Party shall state the reasons for its decision. 10. The complaining Party may suspend the obligations 10 days after the date of delivery of the notification referred to in paragraph 2 unless the respondent Party made a request under paragraph 11. 11. If the respondent Party considers that the notified level of suspension of obligations exceeds the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation or that the principles and procedures set forth in point (b) of paragraph 7, paragraph 8 or paragraph 9 have not been followed, it may deliver a written request to the original arbitration tribunal before the expiry of the 10 day period set out in paragraph 10 to decide on the matter. The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its decision on the level of the suspension of obligations to the Parties within 30 days of the date of the request. Obligations shall not be suspended until the arbitration tribunal has delivered its decision. The suspension of obligations shall be consistent with that decision. 12. The arbitration tribunal acting pursuant to paragraph 11 shall not examine the nature of the obligations to be suspended but shall determine whether the level of such suspension exceeds the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation. However, if the matter referred to arbitration includes a claim that the principles and procedures set forth in point (b) of paragraph 7, paragraph 8 or paragraph 9 have not been followed, the arbitration tribunal shall examine that claim. In the event the arbitration tribunal determines that those principles and procedures have not been followed, the complaining party shall apply them consistently with point (b) of paragraph 7, paragraph 8 and paragraph 9. The parties shall accept the arbitration tribunal's decision as final and shall not seek a second arbitration procedure. This paragraph shall under no circumstances delay the date as of which the complaining Party is entitled to suspend obligations under this Article. 13. The suspension of obligations or the compensation referred to in this Article shall be temporary and shall not be applied after:

The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its decision to the Parties within 46 days of the date of the delivery of the request. If the arbitration tribunal finds that the measure taken to comply is in conformity with the covered provisions, the suspension of obligations or compensation, as the case may be, shall be terminated.

The level of nullified or impaired benefits requested by the complaining Party or determined by the arbitration tribunal: (a) shall not include punitive damages, interest or hypothetical losses of profits or business opportunities; (b) shall be reduced by any prior refunds of duties, indemnification of damages or other forms of compensation already received by the concerned operators or the concerned Party; and (c) shall not include the contribution to the nullification or impairment by wilful or negligent action or omission of the concerned Party or any person or entity in relation to whom remedies are sought pursuant to the intended suspension of obligations.

TITLE II: BASIS FOR COOPERATION Article COMPROV.4: Democracy, rule of law and human rights 1. The Parties shall continue to uphold the shared values and principles of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, which underpin their domestic and international policies. In that regard, the Parties reaffirm their respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights treaties to which they are parties. 2. The Parties shall promote such shared values and principles in international forums. The Parties shall cooperate in promoting those values and principles, including with or in third countries. Article COMPROV.5: Fight against climate change 1. The Parties consider that climate change represents an existential threat to humanity and reiterate their commitment to strengthening the global response to this threat. The fight against human-caused climate change as elaborated in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, and in particular in the Paris Agreement adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its 21st session (the "Paris Agreement"), inspires the domestic and external policies of the Union and the United Kingdom. Accordingly, each Party shall respect the Paris Agreement and the process set up by the UNFCCC and refrain from acts or omissions that would materially defeat the object and purpose of the Paris Agreement. 2. The Parties shall advocate the fight against climate change in international forums, including by engaging with other countries and regions to increase their level of ambition in the reduction of greenhouse emissions. Article COMPROV.6: Countering proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 1. The Parties consider that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery, to both state and non-state actors, represents one of the most serious threats to international stability and security. The Parties therefore agree to cooperate and to contribute to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery through full compliance with and national implementation of existing obligations under international disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and other relevant international obligations. 2. The Parties, furthermore, agree to cooperate on and to contribute to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery by: (a) taking steps to sign, ratify, or accede to, as appropriate, and fully implement all other relevant international instruments; and

(b)

establishing an effective system of national export controls, controlling the export as well as transit of WMD-related goods, including a WMD end-use control on dual use technologies and containing effective sanctions for breaches of export controls. The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters. Article COMPROV.7: Small arms and light weapons and other conventional weapons

3.

1. The Parties recognise that the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons (SALW), including their ammunition, their excessive accumulation, their poor management, inadequately secured stockpiles and their uncontrolled spread continue to pose a serious threat to peace and international security. 2. The Parties agree to observe and fully implement their respective obligations to deal with the illicit trade in SALW, including their ammunition, under existing international agreements and UN Security Council resolutions, as well as their respective commitments within the framework of other international instruments applicable in this area, such as the UN Programme of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW in all its aspects. 3. The Parties recognise the importance of domestic control systems for the transfer of conventional arms in line with existing international standards. The Parties recognise the importance of applying such controls in a responsible manner, as a contribution to international and regional peace, security and stability, and to the reduction of human suffering, as well as to the prevention of diversion of conventional weapons. 4. The Parties undertake, in that regard, to fully implement the Arms Trade Treaty and to cooperate with each other within the framework of that Treaty, including in promoting the universalisation and full implementation of that Treaty by all UN member states. 5. The Parties therefore undertake to cooperate in their efforts to regulate or improve the regulation of international trade in conventional arms and to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in arms. 6. The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters. Article COMPROV.8: The most serious crimes of concern to the international community 1. The Parties reaffirm that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation, including with the International Criminal Court. The Parties agree to fully support the universality and integrity of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and related instruments. 2. The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters. Article COMPROV.9: Counter-terrorism 1. The Parties shall cooperate at the bilateral, regional and international levels to prevent and combat acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in accordance with international law, including, where applicable, international counterterrorism-related agreements, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as well as in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 398

2. The Parties shall enhance cooperation on counter-terrorism, including preventing and countering violent extremism and the financing of terrorism, with the aim of advancing their common security interests, taking into account the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, without prejudice to law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and intelligence exchanges. 3. The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters. This dialogue will, inter alia, aim to promote and facilitate: (a) (b) (c) (d) the sharing of assessments on the terrorist threat; the exchange of best practices and expertise on counter terrorism; operational cooperation and exchange of information; and exchanges on cooperation in the framework of multilateral organisations. Article COMPROV.10: Personal data protection 1. The Parties affirm their commitment to ensuring a high level of personal data protection. They shall endeavour to work together to promote high international standards. 2. The Parties recognise that individuals have a right to the protection of personal data and privacy and that high standards in this regard contribute to trust in the digital economy and to the development of trade, and are a key enabler for effective law enforcement cooperation. To that end, the Parties shall undertake to respect, each in the framework of their respective laws and regulations, the commitments they have made in this Agreement in connection with that right. 3. The Parties shall cooperate at bilateral and multilateral levels, while respecting their respective laws and regulations. Such cooperation may include dialogue, exchanges of expertise, and cooperation on enforcement, as appropriate, with respect to personal data protection. 4. Where this Agreement or any supplementing agreement provide for the transfer of personal data, such transfer shall take place in accordance with the transferring Party's rules on international transfers of personal data. For greater certainty, this paragraph is without prejudice to the application of any specific provisions in this Agreement relating to the transfer of personal data, in particular Article DIGIT.7 [Protection of personal data and privacy] and Article LAWGEN.4 [Protection of personal data], and to Title I of Part Six [Dispute Settlement]. Where needed, each Party will make best efforts, while respecting its rules on international transfers of personal data, to establish safeguards necessary for the transfer of personal data, taking into account any recommendations of the Partnership Council under point (h) of Article INST.1(4) [Partnership Council]. Article COMPROV.11: Global cooperation on issues of shared economic, environmental and social interest 1. The Parties recognise the importance of global cooperation to address issues of shared economic, environmental and social interest. Where it is in their mutual interest, they shall promote multilateral solutions to common problems. 2. While preserving their decision-making autonomy, and without prejudice to other provisions of this Agreement or any supplementing agreement, the Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on current and emerging global issues of common interest such as peace and security, climate change, sustainable development, cross-border pollution, environmental protection, digitalisation, public 399

health and consumer protection, taxation, financial stability, and free and fair trade and investment. To that end, they shall endeavour to maintain a constant and effective dialogue and to coordinate their positions in multilateral organisations and forums in which the Parties participate, such as the United Nations, the Group of Seven (G-7) and the Group of Twenty (G-20), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. Article COMPROV.12: Essential elements Article COMPROV.4(1) [Democracy, rule of law and human rights], Article COMPROV.5(1) [Fight against climate change] and Article COMPROV.6(1) [Countering proliferation of weapons of mass destruction] constitute essential elements of the partnership established by this Agreement and any supplementing agreement. TITLE III: FULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATIONS AND SAFEGUARD MEASURES Article INST.35: Fulfilment of obligations described as essential elements 1. If either Party considers that there has been a serious and substantial failure by the other Party to fulfil any of the obligations that are described as essential elements in Article COMPROV.12 [Essential elements], it may decide to terminate or suspend the operation of this Agreement or any supplementing agreement in whole or in part. 2. Before doing so, the Party invoking the application of this Article shall request that the Partnership Council meet immediately, with a view to seeking a timely and mutually agreeable solution. If no mutually agreeable solution is found within 30 days from the date of the request to the Partnership Council, the Party may take the measures referred to in paragraph 1. 3. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be in full respect of international law and shall be proportionate. Priority shall be given to the measures which least disturb the functioning of this Agreement and of any supplementing agreements. 4. The Parties consider that, for a situation to constitute a serious and substantial failure to fulfil any of the obligations described as essential elements in Article COMPROV.12 [Essential Elements], its gravity and nature would have to be of an exceptional sort that threatens peace and security or that has international repercussions. For greater certainty, an act or omission which materially defeats the object and purpose of the Paris Agreement shall always be considered as a serious and substantial failure for the purposes of this Article. Article INST.36: Safeguard measures 1. If serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties of a sectorial or regional nature, including in relation to fishing activities and their dependent communities, that are liable to persist arise, the Party concerned may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures. Such safeguard measures shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation. Priority shall be given to those measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. 2. The Party concerned shall, without delay, notify the other Party through the Partnership Council and shall provide all relevant information. The Parties shall immediately enter into consultations in the Partnership Council with a view to finding a mutually agreeable solution. 400

3. The Party concerned may not take safeguard measures until one month has elapsed after the date of notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the consultation procedure pursuant to paragraph 2 has been jointly concluded before the expiration of the stated time limit. When exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action exclude prior examination, the Party concerned may apply forthwith the safeguard measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. The Party concerned shall, without delay, notify the measures taken to the Partnership Council and shall provide all relevant information. 4. If a safeguard measure taken by the Party concerned creates an imbalance between the rights and obligations under this Agreement or under any supplementing agreement, the other Party may take such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance. Priority shall be given to those measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. Paragraphs 2 to 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to such rebalancing measures. 5. Either Party may, without having prior recourse to consultations pursuant to Article INST.13 [Consultations], initiate the arbitration procedure referred to in Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure] to challenge a measure taken by the other Party in application of paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article. 6. The safeguard measures referred to in paragraph 1 and the rebalancing measures referred to in paragraph 5 may also be taken in relation to a supplementing agreement, unless otherwise provided therein.

In this Article, the "designated powers" means the powers:

(a) to make regulations pursuant to sections 17A, 17C and 74A of the UK Data Protection Act 2018; (b) to issue a new document specifying standard data protection clauses pursuant to section 119A of the UK Data Protection Act 2018; (c) to approve a new draft code of conduct pursuant to Article 40(5) of the UK GDPR, other than a code of conduct which cannot be relied on to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal data to a third country under Article 46(2)(e) of the UK GDPR; (d) to approve new certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42(5) of the UK GDPR, other than certification mechanisms which cannot be relied on to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal data to a third country under Article 46(2)(f) of the UK GDPR; (e) to approve new binding corporate rules pursuant to Article 47 of the UK GDPR; (f) to authorise new contractual clauses referred to in Article 46(3)(a) of the UK GDPR; or (g) to authorise new administrative arrangements referred to in Article 46(3)(b) of the UK GDPR. 4.

6. The references to exercising the designated powers in paragraphs 1 and 5 do not include the exercise of such powers the effect of which is limited to alignment with the relevant Union data protection law. 7. Anything that would otherwise be an amendment to the applicable data protection regime which is: (a) made with the agreement of the Union within the Partnership Council; or (b) limited to alignment with the relevant Union data protection law; shall not be treated as an amendment to the applicable data protection regime for the purposes of paragraph 5 and instead should be treated as being part of the applicable data protection regime for the purposes of paragraph 1. 8. For the purposes of paragraphs 1, 5 and 7, "the agreement of the Union within the Partnership Council" means: (a) a decision of the Partnership Council as described in paragraph 11; or (b) deemed agreement as described in paragraph 10. 9. Where the United Kingdom notifies the Union that it proposes to exercise the designated powers or proposes to amend the applicable data protection regime, either party may request, within five working days, a meeting of the Partnership Council which must take place within two weeks of such request. 10. If no such meeting is requested, the Union is deemed to have given agreement to such exercise or amendment during the specified period. 11. If such a meeting is requested, at that meeting the Partnership Council shall consider the proposed exercise or amendment and may adopt a decision stating that it agrees to the exercise or amendment during the specified period. 12.

Following a notification by the United Kingdom under this paragraph, the Union may request a meeting of the Partnership Council to discuss the relevant instrument. 13. Title I [Dispute Settlement] of Part Six does not apply in respect of disputes regarding the interpretation and application of this Article.

ANNEX ORIG-1: INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN Note 1 General Principles 1. This Annex sets out the general rules for the applicable requirements of Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] as provided for in point (c) of Article ORIG 3(1) [General requirements] of this Agreement. 2. For the purposes of this Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the requirements for a product to be originating in accordance with point (c) of Article ORIG.3(1) [General Requirements] of this Agreement are a change in tariff classification, a production process, a maximum value or weight of non-originating materials, or any other requirement specified in this Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin]. 3. Reference to weight in a product-specific rule of origin means the net weight, which is the weight of a material or a product, not including the weight of any packaging. 4. This Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] are based on the Harmonised System, as amended on 1 January 2017. Note 2 The Structure of the List of Product-specific Rules of Origin 1. Notes on sections or chapters, where applicable, are read in conjunction with the productspecific rules of origin for the relevant section, chapter, heading or subheading. 2. Each product-specific rule of origin set out in Column 2 of Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] applies to the corresponding product indicated in Column 1 of Annex ORIG-2 [Productspecific rules of origin]. 3. If a product is subject to alternative product-specific rules of origin, the product shall be originating in a Party if it satisfies one of the alternatives. 4. If a product is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes multiple requirements, the product shall be originating in a Party only if it satisfies all of the requirements. 5. For the purposes of this Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the following definitions apply: (a) (b) `section' means a section of the Harmonised System; `Chapter' means the first two-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised System; `heading' means the first four-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised System; and `subheading' means the first six-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised System. 415

2.

For the purposes of the product-specific rules of origin, the following abbreviations apply:

`CC' means production from non-originating materials of any Chapter, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a Chapter (2-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in Chapter); `CTH' means production from non-originating materials of any heading, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a heading (4-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in heading); `CTSH' means production from non-originating materials of any subheading, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a subheading (6-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in sub-heading). Note 3 Application of the Product-specific Rules of Origin 1. Article ORIG.3(2) [General requirements] of this Agreement, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the production of other products, applies whether or not this status has been acquired inside the same factory in a Party where these products are used. 2. If a product-specific rule of origin specifically excludes certain non-originating material or provides that the value or weight of a specified non-originating material shall not exceed a specific threshold, these conditions do not apply to non-originating materials classified elsewhere in the Harmonised System. 3. Example 1: when the rule for bulldozers (HS sub-heading 8429.11) requires: "CTH except from non-originating materials of heading 84.31 parts suitable solely for machinery of heading 84.25 to 84.30", the use of non-originating materials classified elsewhere than 84.29 and 84.31- such as screws (HS heading 73.18), insulated wires and electric conductors (HS heading 85.44) and various electronics (HS Chapter 85) - is not limited. Example 2: When the rule for heading 35.05 (dextrins and other modified starches; glues based on starches etc) requires `CTH except from non-originating heading 11.08' then the use of non-originating materials classified elsewhere than 11.08 (starches, inulin), such as materials of Chapter 10 (cereals), is not limited. 4. If a product-specific rule of origin provides that a product shall be produced from a particular material, this does not prevent the use of other materials which are unable to satisfy that rule because of their inherent nature. Note 4 Calculation of a maximum value of non-originating materials For the purposes of the product-specific rules of origin, the following definitions apply:

(ii)

(e) (f)

`isomer separation' means the isolation or separation of isomers from a mixture of isomers; `mixing and blending' means the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials, other than the addition of diluents, only to conform to predetermined specifications which results in the production of a product having physical or chemical characteristics that are relevant to the purposes or uses of the product and are different from the input materials; `production of standard materials' (including standard solutions) means a production of a preparation suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing uses with precise degrees of purity or proportions certified by the producer; and 418

(aa)

yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;

(bb) yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped; (cc) products of heading 56.05 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film irrespective of whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;

(dd) other products of heading 56.05; (ee) glass fibres; and (ff) metal fibres.

2. Where reference to this Note is made in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the requirements set out in its Column 2 shall not apply, as a tolerance, to non-originating basic textile materials which are used in the production of a product, provided that: (a) (b) the product contains two or more basic textile materials; and the weight of the non-originating basic textile materials, taken together, does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. Example: For a woollen fabric of heading 51.12 containing woollen yarn of heading 51.07, synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 55.09 and materials other than basic textile materials, non-originating woollen yarn which does not satisfy the requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], or non-originating synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], or a combination of both, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of all the basic textile materials. 3. Notwithstanding Note 7.2 (b), for products containing `yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped', the maximum tolerance is 20 %. However, the percentage of the other non-originating basic textile materials shall not exceed 10 %. 4. Notwithstanding Note 7.2 (b), for products containing `strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film irrespective of whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film, the maximum tolerance is 30 %. However, the percentage of the other non-originating basic textile materials shall not exceed 10 %. Note 8 Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products 1. Where reference to this Note is made in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of Origin], nonoriginating textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings) which do not satisfy the requirements set out in its Column 2 for a made-up textile product may be used, provided that they 421

are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the EXW of the product. 2. Non-originating materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 may be used without restriction in the production of textile products classified in Chapters 50 to 63, whether or not they contain textiles. Example: If a requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] provides that yarn shall be used, for a certain textile item (such as trousers), this does not prevent the use of non-originating metal items (such as buttons), because metal items are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reasons, it does not prevent the use of nonoriginating slide fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles. 3. Where a requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] consists in a maximum value of non-originating materials, the value of the non-originating materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 shall be taken into account in the calculation of the value of the nonoriginating materials. Note 9 Agricultural Products Agricultural products classified under Section II of the Harmonised System and heading 24.01, which are grown or harvested in the territory of a Party, shall be treated as originating in the territory of that Party, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, slips, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from a third country.

ANNEX ORIG-3: SUPPLIER'S DECLARATION 1. A supplier's declaration shall have the content set out in this Annex. 2. Except in the cases referred to in point 3, a supplier's declaration shall be made out by the supplier for each consignment of products in the form provided for in Appendix 1 and annexed to the invoice, or to any other document describing the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. 3. Where a supplier regularly supplies a particular customer with products for which the production carried out in a Party is expected to remain constant for a period of time, that supplier may provide a single supplier's declaration to cover subsequent consignments of those products (the `longterm supplier's declaration'). A long-term supplier's declaration is normally valid for a period of up to two years from the date of making out the declaration. The customs authorities of the Party where the declaration is made out may lay down the conditions under which longer periods may be used. The long-term supplier's declaration shall be made out by the supplier in the form provided for in Appendix 2 and shall describe the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The supplier shall inform the customer immediately if the long-term supplier's declaration ceases to apply to the products supplied. 4. The supplier making out a declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the Party where the declaration is made out, all appropriate documents proving that the information given on that declaration is correct.

(2) The information requested does not have to be given unless it is necessary. Examples: One of the rules for garments of Chapter 62 provides "Weaving combined with making-up including cutting of fabric". If a manufacturer of such garments in a Party uses fabric imported from the other Party which has been obtained there by weaving non-originating yarn, it is sufficient for the supplier in the latter Party to describe in his declaration the non-originating material used as yarn, without it being necessary to indicate the HS heading and the value of such yarn. A producer of wire of iron of HS heading 7217 who has produced it from non-originating iron bars should indicate in the second column 'bars of iron'. Where that wire is to be used in the production of a machine for which the rule contains a limitation for all non-originating materials used to a certain percentage value, it is necessary to indicate in the third column the value of non-originating bars. (3) `Value of non-originating materials used' means the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product, which is its customs value at the time of importation, including freight, insurance if appropriate, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the importation port in the Party where the producer of the product is located; where the value of the non-originating materials is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the non-originating materials in the Union or in the United Kingdom is used.

Article 3: Objectives With regard to the products covered, the objectives of this Annex are to: (a) (b) eliminate and prevent any unnecessary technical barriers to bilateral trade; promote the compatibility and convergence of regulations based on international standards; promote the recognition of approvals based on approval schemes applied under the agreements administered by WP.29; reinforce competitive market conditions based on principles of openness, nondiscrimination and transparency; promote high levels of protection of human health, safety and the environment; and maintain cooperation on issues of mutual interest to foster continued mutually beneficial development in trade. Article 4: Relevant international standards The Parties recognise that the WP.29 is the relevant international standardising body and that UN Regulations and GTRs under the 1958 Agreement and 1998 Agreement are relevant international standards for the products covered by this Annex. Article 5: Regulatory convergence based on relevant international standards 1. The Parties shall refrain from introducing or maintaining any domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure diverging from UN Regulations or GTRs in areas covered by such Regulations or GTRs, including where the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs have not been completed but their completion is imminent, unless there are substantiated reasons why a specific UN Regulation or GTR is an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued, for example, in the areas of road safety or the protection of the environment or human health. 2. A Party which introduces a divergent domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure as referred to in paragraph 1, at the request of the other Party, shall identify the parts of the domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure which substantially diverge from the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs and provide justification for the divergence. 3. Each Party shall systematically consider applying UN Regulations adopted after the entry into force of this Agreement, and shall inform each other of any changes regarding the implementation of those UN Regulations in its respective domestic legal system following the protocol established under the 1958 Agreement and in line with Articles 8 and 9. 4. Insofar as a Party has introduced or maintains domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures that diverge from UN Regulations or GTRs as permitted by paragraph 1, that Party shall review those domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures at regular intervals, preferably not exceeding five years, with a view to 488

increasing their convergence with the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs. When reviewing their domestic technical regulations, markings and conformity assessment procedures, each Party shall consider whether the justification for the divergence still exists. The outcome of these reviews, including any scientific and technical information used, shall be notified to the other Party upon request. 5. Each Party shall refrain from introducing or maintaining domestic technical regulations, markings, or conformity assessment procedures which have the effect of prohibiting, restricting or increasing the burden for the importation and putting into service on their domestic market of products type-approved under UN Regulations for the areas covered by those UN Regulations unless such domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures are explicitly provided for by those UN Regulations. Article 6: Type approval and market surveillance 1 Each Party shall accept on its market products which are covered by a valid UN type-approval certificate as compliant with its domestic technical regulations, markings and conformity assessment procedures, without requiring any further testing or marking to verify or attest compliance with any requirement covered by the UN type approval certificate concerned. In the case of vehicle approvals, the UN Universal International Whole Vehicle Type Approval (U-IWVTA) shall be considered valid in respect of the requirements covered by the U-IWVTA. UN type-approval certificates issued by a Party can only be considered valid if that Party has acceded to the relevant UN Regulations. 2 Each Party shall only be required to accept valid UN type-approval certificates issued pursuant to the latest version of the UN Regulations it has acceded to. 3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, the following shall be considered sufficient proof of the existence of a valid UN type-approval: (a) for whole vehicles, a valid UN Declaration of Conformance certifying compliance with a U-IWVTA; for equipment and parts, a valid UN type-approval mark affixed to the product; or for equipment and parts to which a UN type-approval mark cannot be affixed, a valid UN type-approval certificate.

4. For the purpose of conducting market surveillance, the competent authorities of a Party may verify that the products covered comply, as appropriate, with (a) (b) all the domestic technical regulations of that Party; or the UN Regulations with which compliance has been attested, in accordance with this Article, by a valid UN Declaration of Conformance certifying compliance with a UIWVTA in the case of whole vehicles, or by a valid UN type-approval mark affixed to the product or a valid UN type-approval certificate in the case of equipment and parts.

Such verifications shall be carried out by random sampling in the market and in accordance with the technical regulations referred to in point (a) or (b) of this paragraph, as the case may be.

2. The Parties shall exchange all the necessary information, including changes to their respective laws, regulations, technical guidelines or inspection procedures relating to Good Manufacturing Practice so that each Party can consider whether the conditions for the recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents pursuant to Article 5(1) continue to exist. 3. If as a result of any of the new measures or changes referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, a Party considers that it can no longer recognise inspections or accept official GMP documents issued by the other Party, it shall notify the other Party of its intention to apply Article 9 and the Parties shall enter into consultations within the Working Group on Medicinal Products. 4. Any notification under this Article shall be done via the designated contact points in the Working Group on Medicinal Products. Article 9: Suspension 1. Without prejudice to Article 5(2), each Party has the right to suspend totally or partially the recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents of the other Party pursuant to Article 5(1) for all or some of the products listed in Appendix C. That right shall be exercised in an objective and reasoned manner. The Party exercising such right shall notify the other Party and provide a written justification. A Party shall continue to accept official GMP documents of the other Party issued prior to such suspension, unless the Party decides otherwise on the basis of health or safety considerations. 2. Where, following consultations referred to in Article 8(3), a Party nevertheless suspends the recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents pursuant to Article 5(1), it may do so in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article not earlier than 60 days after the commencement of the consultations. During that 60-day period, both Parties shall continue to recognise inspections and accept official GMP documents issued by an authority of the other Party. 3. Where recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents pursuant to Article 5(1) is suspended, at the request of a Party, the Parties shall discuss the matter within the Working Group on Medicinal Products and they shall make every effort to consider possible measures that would enable the recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents to be restored. Article 10: Regulatory cooperation 1. The Parties shall endeavour to consult one another, as permitted by their respective law, on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures, including those that affect how documents from the other Party are recognised in accordance with Article 5 and, where appropriate, to provide the opportunity to comment on such proposals, without prejudice to Article 8. 2.

The reservations of a Party are without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under GATS. 3. Each reservation sets out the following elements: (a) "sector" refers to the general sector in which the reservation is taken; (b) "sub-sector" refers to the specific sector in which the reservation is taken; (c) "industry classification" refers, where applicable, to the activity covered by the reservation according to the CPC, ISIC Rev. 3.1, or as expressly otherwise described in that reservation; (d) "type of reservation" specifies the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 for which a reservation is taken; (e) "level of government" indicates the level of government maintaining the measure for which a reservation is taken; (f) "measures" identifies the laws or other measures as qualified, where indicated, by the "description" element for which the reservation is taken.

(iii)

in respect of the schedule of the European Union, includes any laws or other measures which implement a directive at Member State level; and

(g) "description" sets out the non-conforming aspects of the existing measure for which the reservation is taken. 4. For greater certainty, if a Party adopts a new measure at a level of government different to that at which the reservation was originally taken, and this new measure effectively replaces ­ within the territory to which it applies ­ the non-conforming aspect of the original measure cited in the `measures' element, the new measure shall be deemed to constitute `modification' to the original measure within the meaning of Article SERVIN.2.7(1)(c) [Non-conforming measures ­ Investment liberalisation]; Article SERVIN.3.6(1)(c) [Non-conforming measures ­ Cross-border trade in services]; Article 4.5(c) [Non-conforming measures ­ Entry and temporary stay of natural persons for business purposes] and Article SERVIN.5.50 [Non-conforming measures ­ Legal services]. 5. In the interpretation of a reservation, all elements of the reservation shall be considered. A reservation shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant obligations of the Chapters or Sections against which the reservation is taken. The "measures" element shall prevail over all other elements. 6. For the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union: (a) "ISIC Rev. 3.1" means the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, No.4, ISIC Rev. 3.1, 2002; (b) "CPC" means the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical Papers, Series M No. 77, Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the United Nations, New York, 1991). 7. For the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union, a reservation for a requirement to have a local presence in the territory of the Union or the United Kingdom is taken against Article SERVIN 3.3 [Local presence], and not against Article SERVIN 3.2 [Market access] or SERVIN 3.4 [National treatment]. Furthermore, such a requirement is not taken as a reservation against Article SERVIN 2.3 [National treatment]. 8. A reservation taken at the level of the Union applies to a measure of the Union, to a measure of a Member State at the central level or to a measure of a government within a Member State, unless the reservation excludes a Member State. A reservation taken by a Member State applies to a measure of a government at the central, regional or local level within that Member State. For the purposes of the reservations of Belgium, the central level of government covers the federal government and the governments of the regions and the communities as each of them holds equipollent legislative powers. For the purposes of the reservations of the Union and its Member States, a regional level of government in Finland means the Åland Islands. A reservation taken at the level of the United Kingdom applies to a measure of the central government, a regional government or a local government. 9. The list of reservations below does not include measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures where they do not constitute a limitation within the meaning of Article SERVIN.2.2 [Market access ­ Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment ­ Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access ­ Cross-border trade in services], Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence ­ Cross-border trade in services], Article SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment ­ Cross-border 531

trade in services] or Article SERVIN 5.49 [Obligations ­ Legal services]. These measures may include, in particular, the need to obtain a licence, to satisfy universal service obligations, to have recognised qualifications in regulated sectors, to pass specific examinations, including language examinations, to fulfil a membership requirement of a particular profession, such as membership in a professional organisation, to have a local agent for service, or to maintain a local address, or any other nondiscriminatory requirements that certain activities may not be carried out in protected zones or areas. While not listed, such measures continue to apply. 10. For greater certainty, for the Union, the obligation to grant national treatment does not entail the requirement to extend to natural or legal persons of the United Kingdom the treatment granted in a Member State, pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or any measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the Member States, to: (i) (ii) natural persons or residents of another Member State; or legal persons constituted or organised under the law of another Member State or of the Union and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business in the Union.

11. Treatment granted to legal persons established by investors of a Party in accordance with the law of the other Party (including, in the case of the Union, the law of a Member State) and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within that other Party, is without prejudice to any condition or obligation, consistent with Chapter 2 [Investment liberalisation] of Title II [Services and investment] of Heading One [Trade] of Part Two [Trade, transport and fisheries], which may have been imposed on such legal person when it was established in that other Party, and which shall continue to apply. 12. The schedules apply only to the territories of the United Kingdom and the Union in accordance with Article FINPROV.1[Territorial scope] and Article OTH.9(2) [Geographical scope] and are only relevant in the context of trade relations between the Union and its Member States with the United Kingdom. They do not affect the rights and obligations of the Member States under Union law. 13. For greater certainty, non-discriminatory measures do not constitute a market access limitation within the meaning of Articles SERVIN. 2.2 [Market access ­ Investment liberalisation], SERVIN.3.2 [Market access ­ Cross-border trade in services], or Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations ­ Legal services] for any measure: (a) requiring the separation of the ownership of infrastructure from the ownership of the goods or services provided through that infrastructure to ensure fair competition, for example in the fields of energy, transportation and telecommunications; (b) restricting the concentration of ownership to ensure fair competition; (c) seeking to ensure the conservation and protection of natural resources and the environment, including a limitation on the availability, number and scope of concessions granted, and the imposition of a moratorium or ban; (d) limiting the number of authorisations granted because of technical or physical constraints, for example telecommunications spectra and frequencies; or

(e) requiring that a certain percentage of the shareholders, owners, partners, or directors of an enterprise be qualified or practice a certain profession such as lawyers or accountants. 14. With respect to financial services: Unlike foreign subsidiaries, branches established directly in a Member State by a non-European Union financial institution are not, with certain limited exceptions, subject to prudential regulations harmonised at Union level which enable such subsidiaries to benefit from enhanced facilities to set up new establishments and to provide crossborder services throughout the Union. Therefore, such branches receive an authorisation to operate in the territory of a Member State under conditions equivalent to those applied to domestic financial institutions of that Member State, and may be required to satisfy a number of specific prudential requirements such as, in the case of banking and securities, separate capitalisation and other solvency requirements and reporting and publication of accounts requirements or, in the case of insurance, specific guarantee and deposit requirements, a separate capitalisation, and the localisation in the Member State concerned of the assets representing the technical reserves and at least one third of the solvency margin.

In AT (applies to the regional level of government): The acquisition, purchase and rental or leasing of real estate by non-European Union natural persons and enterprises requires authorisation by the competent regional authorities (Länder). Authorisation will only be granted if the acquisition is considered to be in the public (in particular economic, social and cultural) interest. In CY: Cypriots or persons of Cypriot origin, as well as nationals of a Member State, are allowed to acquire any property in Cyprus without restrictions. A foreigner shall not acquire, otherwise than mortis causa, any immovable property without obtaining a permit from the Council of Ministers. For foreigners, where the acquisition of immovable property exceeds the extent necessary for the erection of a premises for a house or professional roof, or otherwise exceeds the extent of two donums (2,676 square meter), any permit granted by the Council of Ministers shall be subject to such terms, limitations, conditions and criteria which are set by Regulations made by the Council of Ministers and approved by the House of Representatives. A foreigner is any person who is not a citizen of the Republic of Cyprus, including a foreign controlled company. The term does not include foreigners of Cypriot origin or non-Cypriot spouses of citizens of the Republic of Cyprus. In CZ: Specific rules apply to agricultural land under state ownership. State agricultural land can be acquired only by Czech nationals, nationals of another Member State, or states parties to the Agreement on the EEA or the Swiss Confederation. Legal persons can acquire state agriculture land from the state only if they are agricultural entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic or persons with similar status in other Member State of the European Union, or states parties to the Agreement on the EEA or the Swiss Confederation. In DK: Natural persons who are not resident in Denmark, and who have not previously been resident in Denmark for a total period of five years, must in accordance with the Danish Acquisition Act obtain permission from the Ministry of Justice to acquire title to real property in Denmark. This also applies for legal persons that are not registered in Denmark. For natural persons, acquisition of real property will be permitted if the applicant is going to use the real property as his or her primary residence. For legal persons that are not registered in Denmark, acquisition of real property will in general be permitted, if the acquisition is a prerequisite for the business activities of the purchaser. Permission is also required if the applicant is going to use the real property as a secondary dwelling. Such permission will only be granted if the applicant through an overall and concrete assessment is regarded to have particular strong ties to Denmark. Permission under the Acquisition Act is only granted for the acquisition of a specific real property. The acquisition of agricultural land by natural or legal persons is in addition governed by the Danish Agricultural Holdings Act, which imposes restrictions on all persons, Danish or foreign, when acquiring agricultural property. Accordingly, any natural or legal person, who wishes to acquire agricultural real property, must fulfil the requirements in this Act. This generally means a limited residence requirement on the agricultural holding applies. The residence requirement is not personal. Legal entities must be of the types listed in §20 and §21 of the act and must be registered in the Union (or EEA). In EE: A legal person from an OECD Member State has the right to acquire an immovable which contains:

i. less than ten hectares of agricultural land, forest land or agricultural and forest land in total
without restrictions.

ii. ten hectares or more of agricultural land if the legal person has been engaged, for three years
immediately preceding the year of making the transaction of acquisition of the immovable, in production of agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, except fishery products and cotton (hereinafter agricultural product).

iii. ten hectares or more of forest land if the legal person has been engaged, for three years
immediately preceding the year of making the transaction of acquisition of the immovable, in forest management within the meaning of the Forest Act (hereinafter forest management) or production of agricultural products.

iv. less than ten hectares of agricultural land and less than ten hectares of forest land, but ten
hectares or more of agricultural and forest land in total, if the legal person has been engaged, for three years immediately preceding the year of making the transaction of acquisition of the immovable, in production of agricultural products or forest management. If a legal person does not meet the requirements provided for in (ii)­(iv), the legal person may acquire an immovable which contains ten hectares or more of agricultural land, forest land or agricultural and forest land in total only with the authorisation of the council of the local government of the location of the immovable to be acquired. Restrictions on acquiring immovable property apply in certain geographical areas for non-EEA nationals.

ANNEX SERVIN-2: FUTURE MEASURES Headnotes 1. The Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union set out, under Article SERVIN 2.7 [Nonconforming measures ­ Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.3.6 [Non-conforming measures ­ Cross-border trade in services] and Article SERVIN.5.50 [Non-conforming measures ­ Legal services], the reservations taken by the United Kingdom and the Union with respect to existing measures that do not conform with obligations imposed by: (a) Articles SERVIN.2.2 [Market access­ Investment liberalisation] or SERVIN.3.2 [Market access - Cross-border trade in services]; (b) Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence ­ Cross-border trade in services]; (c) Articles SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment­ Investment liberalisation] or SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment - Cross-border trade in services]; (d) Articles SERVIN.2.4 [Most-favoured-nation treatment­ Investment liberalisation], or SERVIN.3.5 [Most-favoured-nation treatment - Cross-border trade in services]; (e) Article SERVIN.2.5 [Senior management and boards of directors]; (f) Article SERVIN.2.6 [Performance requirements]; or (g) Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations ­ Legal services]. 2. The reservations of a Party are without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under GATS. 3. Each reservation sets out the following elements: (a) "sector" refers to the general sector in which the reservation is taken; (b) "sub-sector" refers to the specific sector in which the reservation is taken; (c) "industry classification" refers, where applicable, to the activity covered by the reservation according to the CPC, ISIC rev 3.1, or as expressly otherwise described in a Party's reservation; (d) "type of reservation" specifies the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 for which a reservation is taken; (e) "description" sets out the scope of the sector, sub-sector or activities covered by the reservation; and (f) "existing measures" identifies, for transparency purposes, existing measures that apply to the sector, sub-sector or activities covered by the reservation. 4.

(a) `ISIC Rev. 3.1' means the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, No.4, ISIC Rev. 3.1, 2002; (b)`CPC' means the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical Papers, Series M No. 77, Department of Interntional Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the United Nations, New York,1991). 6. For the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union, a reservation for a requirement to have a local presence in the territory of the Union or the United Kingdom is taken against Article SERVIN 3.3 [Local presence], and not against Article SERVIN 3.2 [Market access] or SERVIN 3.4 [National treatment]. Furthermore, such a requirement is not taken as a reservation against Article SERVIN 2.3 [National treatment]. 7. A reservation taken at the level of the Union applies to a measure of the Union, to a measure of a Member State at the central level or to a measure of a government within a Member State, unless the reservation excludes a Member State. A reservation taken by a Member State applies to a measure of a government at the central, regional or local level within that Member State. For the purposes of the reservations of Belgium, the central level of government covers the federal government and the governments of the regions and the communities as each of them holds equipollent legislative powers. For the purposes of the reservations of the Union and its Member States, a regional level of government in Finland means the Åland Islands. A reservation taken at the level of the United Kingdom applies to a measure of the central government, a regional government or a local government. 8. The list of reservations below does not include measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures where they do not constitute a limitation within the meaning of Article SERVIN.2.2 [Market Access ­ Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.2.3 [National Treatment ­ Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access ­ Cross-border trade in services], Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence ­ Cross-Border Trade in Services], Article SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment ­ Cross-sorder trade in services] or Article SERVIN 5.49 [Obligations ­ Legal services]. These measures may include, in particular the need to obtain a licence, to satisfy universal service obligations, to have recognised qualifications in regulated sectors, to pass specific examinations, including language examinations, to fulfil a membership requirement of a particular profession, such as membership in a professional organisation, to have a local agent for service, or to maintain a local address, or any other nondiscriminatory requirements that certain activities may not be carried out in protected zones or areas. While not listed, such measures continue to apply. 9. For greater certainty, for the European Union, the obligation to grant national treatment does not entail the requirement to extend to natural or legal persons of the United Kingdom the treatment granted in a Member State, pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or any measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the Member States, to: (i) natural persons or residents of another Member State; or (ii) legal persons constituted or organised under the law of another Member State or of the Union and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business in the Union. 645

10. Treatment granted to legal persons established by investors of a Party in accordance with the law of the other Party (including, in the case of the Union, the law of a Member State) and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within that other Party, is without prejudice to any condition or obligation, consistent with Chapter 2 [Investment Liberalisation] of Title II [Services and Investment] of Heading One [Trade] of Part Two [Trade, transport and fisheries], which may have been imposed on such legal person when it was established in that other Party, and which shall continue to apply. 11. The schedules apply only to the territories of the United Kingdom and the European Union in accordance with Article FINPROV.1 [Territorial Scope] and Article OTH.9.2 [Geographical Scope] and are only relevant in the context of trade relations between the Union and its Member States with the United Kingdom. They do not affect the rights and obligations of the Member States under Union law. 12. For greater certainty, non-discriminatory measures do not constitute a market access limitation within the meaning of Articles SERVIN. 2.2 [Market access ­ Investment liberalisation], or SERVIN.3.2 [Market access ­ Cross-border trade in services] or Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations ­ Legal services] for any measure: (a) requiring the separation of the ownership of infrastructure from the ownership of the goods or services provided through that infrastructure to ensure fair competition, for example in the fields of energy, transportation and telecommunications; (b) restricting the concentration of ownership to ensure fair competition; (c) seeking to ensure the conservation and protection of natural resources and the environment, including a limitation on the availability, number and scope of concessions granted, and the imposition of a moratorium or ban; (d) limiting the number of authorisations granted because of technical or physical constraints, for example telecommunications spectra and frequencies; or (e) requiring that a certain percentage of the shareholders, owners, partners, or directors of an enterprise be qualified or practice a certain profession such as lawyers or accountants. 13. With respect to financial services: Unlike foreign subsidiaries, branches established directly in a Member State by a non-European Union financial institution are not, with certain limited exceptions, subject to prudential regulations harmonised at European Union level which enable such subsidiaries to benefit from enhanced facilities to set up new establishments and to provide crossborder services throughout the Union. Therefore, such branches receive an authorisation to operate in the territory of a Member State under conditions equivalent to those applied to domestic financial institutions of that Member State, and may be required to satisfy a number of specific prudential requirements such as, in the case of banking and securities, separate capitalisation and other solvency requirements and reporting and publication of accounts requirements or, in the case of insurance, specific guarantee and deposit requirements, a separate capitalisation, and the localisation in the Member State concerned of the assets representing the technical reserves and at least one third of the solvency margin.

Exclusive rights on such services are often granted to private operators, for instance operators with concessions from public authorities, subject to specific service obligations.

ANNEX SERVIN-6: GUIDELINES FOR ARRANGEMENTS ON THE RECOGNITION OF PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS SECTION A: General Provisions Introduction 1. This Annex contains guidelines for arrangements on the conditions for the recognition of professional qualifications ("arrangements"), as foreseen by Article SERVIN.5.13 [Professional qualifications]. 2. Pursuant to that Article, these guidelines shall be taken into account in the development of joint recommendations by professional bodies or authorities of the Parties ("joint recommendations"). 3. The guidelines are non-binding, non-exhaustive and do not modify or affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. They set out the typical content of arrangements, and provide general indications as to the economic value of an arrangement and the compatibility of the respective professional qualifications regimes. 4. Not all elements of these guidelines may be relevant in all cases and professional bodies and authorities are free to include in their joint recommendations any other element that they consider pertinent for the arrangements of the profession and the professional activities concerned, consistent with this Agreement. 5. The guidelines should be taken into account by the Partnership Council when deciding whether to develop and adopt arrangements. They are without prejudice to its review of the consistency of joint recommendations with Title II [Services and Investment] of Heading One [Trade] of Part Two [Trade, transport and fisheries]and its discretion to take into account the elements it deems relevant, including those contained in joint recommendations. SECTION B: Form and Content of an Arrangement 6. This section sets out the typical content of an arrangement, some of which is not within the remit of the professional bodies or authorities preparing joint recommendations. These aspects constitute, nonetheless, useful information to be taken into account in the preparation of joint recommendations, so that they are better adapted to the possible scope of an arrangement. 7. Matters addressed specifically in this Agreement which apply to arrangements (such as the geographical scope of an arrangement, its interaction with scheduled non-conforming measures, the system of dispute resolution, appeal mechanisms, monitoring and review mechanisms of the arrangement) should not be addressed by joint recommendations. 8. An arrangement may specify different mechanisms for the recognition of professional qualifications within a Party. It may also be limited, but not necessarily so, to setting the scope of the arrangement, the procedural provisions, the effects of recognition and additional requirements, and the administrative arrangements. 9. An arrangement which is adopted by the Partnership Council should reflect the degree of discretion that is intended to be preserved for competent authorities deciding on recognition. Scope of an Arrangement 770
24.12.2020

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

10. (a)

The arrangement should set out: the specific regulated profession(s), relevant professional title(s) and the activity or group of activities covered by the scope of practice of the regulated profession in both Parties ("scope of practice"); and whether it covers the recognition of professional qualifications for the purpose of access to professional activities on a fixed-term or an indefinite basis. Conditions for recognition

(b)

11. (a)

The arrangement may specify in particular: the professional qualifications necessary for recognition under the arrangement (for example, evidence of formal qualification, professional experience, or other attestation of competence); the degree of discretion preserved by recognition authorities when assessing requests for recognition of these qualifications; and the procedures to deal with variations and gaps between professional qualifications and means to bridge the differences, including the possibility for imposing any compensatory measures or any other relevant conditions and limitations. Procedural provisions

(b)

(c)

12. (a)

The arrangement may set out: the documents required and the form in which they should be presented (for example, by electronic or other means, whether they should be supported by translations or certifications of authenticity, etc.); the steps and procedures in the recognition process, including those relating to possible compensatory measures, corresponding obligations and timelines; and the availability of information relevant to all aspects of the recognition processes and requirements. Effects of recognition and additional requirements

(b)

(c)

13. The arrangement may set out provisions on the effects of recognition (if relevant, also in respect of different modes of supply); 14. The arrangement may describe any additional requirements for the effective exercise of the regulated profession in the host Party. Such requirements may include: (a) (b) (c) (d) registration requirements with local authorities; appropriate language skills; proof of good character; compliance with the requirements of the host Party for use of trade or firm names; 771
24.12.2020

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

(e)

compliance with the rules of ethics, independence and professional conduct requirements of the host Party; need to obtain professional indemnity insurance; rules on disciplinary action, financial responsibility and professional liability; and requirements for continuous professional development. Administration of the arrangement

(f) (g) (h)

15. The arrangement should set out the terms under which it can be reviewed or revoked, and the effects of any revision or revocation. Consideration may also be given to the inclusion of provisions concerning the effects of any recognition previously accorded. SECTION C: Economic value of an envisaged arrangement 16. Pursuant to Article SERVIN 5.13(2) [Professional qualifications], joint recommendations shall be supported by an evidence-based assessment of the economic value of an envisaged arrangement. This may consist of an evaluation of the economic benefits that an arrangement is expected to bring to the economies of both Parties. Such an assessment may assist the Partnership Council when developing and adopting an arrangement. 17. Aspects such as the existing level of market openness, industry needs, market trends and developments, client expectations and requirements and business opportunities would constitute useful elements. 18. The evaluation is not required to be a full and detailed economic analysis, but should provide an explanation of the interest of the profession in, and the expected benefits for the Parties ensuing from, the adoption of an arrangement. SECTION D: Compatibility of respective professional qualification regimes 19. Pursuant to Article SERVIN 5.13(2) [Professional qualifications], joint recommendations shall be supported by an evidence-based assessment of the compatibility of the respective professional qualification regimes. This assessment may assist the Partnership Council when developing and adopting an arrangement. 20. The following process aims at guiding professional bodies and authorities when assessing the compatibility of the respective professional qualifications and activities with a view to simplifying and facilitating the recognition of professional qualifications. Step One: Assessment of the scope of practice and the professional qualifications required to practise the regulated profession in each Party. 21. The assessment of the scope of practice and of the professional qualifications required to practise a regulated profession in each of the Parties should be based on all relevant information. 22. (a) The following elements should be identified: activities or groups of activities covered by the scope of practice of the regulated profession in each Party; and 772
24.12.2020

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

(b)

the professional qualifications required in each Party to practise the regulated profession, which may include any of the following elements: the minimum education required, for example, entry requirements, level of education, length of study and contents of study; the minimum professional experience required, for example, location, length and conditions of practical training or supervised professional practice prior to registration, licensing or equivalent; examinations passed, especially examinations of professional competency; and obtention the acquisition of a licence, or equivalent, certifying, inter alia, the fulfilment of the necessary professional qualification requirements for the pursuit of the profession.

(i)

(ii)

(iii) (iv)

Step Two: Evaluation of the divergence between the scope of practice of, or the professional qualifications required to practise, the regulated profession in each Party. 23. The evaluation of the divergence in the scope of practice of, or in the professional qualifications required to practise, the regulated profession, in each Party, should in particular identify divergence that is substantial. 24. met: (a) Substantial divergence in the scope of practice may exist if all of the following conditions are

one or more activities covered by a regulated profession in the host Party are not covered by the corresponding profession in the Party of origin; such activities are subject to specific training in the host Party; the training for such activities in the host Party covers matters substantially diverging from those covered by the applicant's qualification.

(b) (c)

25. Substantial divergence in the professional qualifications required to practise a regulated profession may exist if there are divergences in the Parties' requirements with regard to the level, duration or content of the training that is required for the pursuit of activities covered by the regulated profession. Step Three: Recognition mechanisms 26. There may be different mechanisms for the recognition of professional qualifications, depending on the circumstances. There may be different mechanisms within a Party. 27. If there is no substantial divergence in the scope of practice and in the professional qualifications required to practise a regulated profession, an arrangement may provide for a simpler, more streamlined recognition process than would be the case where substantial divergence exists. 28. If there is substantial divergence, the arrangement may provide for compensatory measures which are sufficient to remedy such divergence. 29. Where compensatory measures are used to reduce substantial divergence, they should be proportionate to the divergence that they seek to address. Any practical professional experience or 773
24.12.2020

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

formally validated training could be taken into account to assess the extent of the compensatory measures needed. 30. Whether or not the divergence is substantial, the arrangement may take account of the degree of discretion that is intended to be preserved for competent authorities deciding on recognition requests. 31. (a) Compensatory measures may take different forms, including: a period of supervised practice of a regulated profession in the host Party, possibly accompanied by further training, under the responsibility of a qualified person and subject to a regulated assessment; a test made or recognised by the relevant authorities of the host Party to assess the applicant's ability to practice a regulated profession in that Party; or a temporary limitation of the scope of practice; or a combination of those.

(b)

(c)

32. The arrangement could envisage that a choice be given to applicants between different compensatory measures where this could limit the administrative burden for applicants and such measures are equivalent.

ANNEX ENER-2: ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUBSIDIES As part of the principles set out in Article 3.5(14) [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions (Energy and environment)] of Chapter three [Subsidy control] of Title XI [Level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] of Heading One [Trade] of Part Two of this Agreement: (1) Subsidies for electricity generation adequacy, renewable energy and cogeneration shall not undermine the ability of a Party to meet its obligations under Article ENER.6 [Provisions relating to wholesale electricity and gas markets] of this Agreement, shall not unnecessarily affect the efficient use of electricity interconnectors provided for under Article ENER.13 [Efficient use of electricity interconnectors], and, without prejudice to Article ENER 6(3) [Provisions relating to wholesale electricity and gas markets] of this Agreement, shall be determined by means of a transparent, non-discriminatory and effective competitive process; and (a) subsidies for electricity generation adequacy shall provide incentives for capacity providers to be available in times of expected system stress and may be limited to installations not exceeding specified CO2 emission limits; and subsidies for renewable energy and cogeneration shall not affect beneficiaries' obligations or opportunities to participate in electricity markets.

(b)

(2)

Notwithstanding point 1, provided that appropriate measures are put in place to prevent overcompensation, non-competitive procedures may be used to grant subsidies for renewable energy and cogeneration if the potential supply is insufficient to ensure a competitive process, the eligible capacity is unlikely to have a material effect on trade or investment between the Parties, or subsidies are granted for demonstration projects. If partial exemptions from energy-related taxes and levies134 in favour of energy-intensive users are introduced, such exemptions shall not exceed the total amount of the tax or levy. If compensation for electricity-intensive users is granted in the event of an increase in electricity cost resulting from climate policy instruments, it shall be restricted to sectors at significant risk of carbon leakage due to the cost increase. Subsidies for the decarbonisation of emissions linked to own industrial activities shall achieve an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The subsidies shall reduce the emissions directly resulting from the industrial activity. Subsidies for improvements of the energy efficiency of own industrial activities shall improve energy efficiency by reducing energy consumption, either directly or per unit of production.

ANNEX ENER-4: ALLOCATION OF ELECTRICITY INTERCONNECTOR CAPACITY AT THE DAY-AHEAD MARKET TIMEFRAME Part 1 1. The new procedure for the allocation of capacity on electricity interconnectors at the day-ahead market timeframe shall be based on the concept of "Multi-region loose volume coupling". The overall objective of the new procedure shall be to maximise the benefits of trade. As the first step in developing the new procedure, the Parties shall ensure that transmission system operators prepare outline proposals and a cost-benefit analysis. 2. Multi-region loose volume coupling shall involve the development of a market coupling function to determine the net energy positions (implicit allocation) between: (a) bidding zones established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943, which are directly connected to the United Kingdom by an electricity interconnector; and the United Kingdom.

(b)

3. The net energy positions over electricity interconnectors shall be calculated via an implicit allocation process by applying a specific algorithm to: (a) commercial bids and offers for the day-ahead market timeframe from the bidding zones established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943 which are directly connected to the United Kingdom by an electricity interconnector; commercial bids and offers for the day-ahead market timeframe from relevant day-ahead markets in the United Kingdom; network capacity data and system capabilities determined in accordance with the procedures agreed between transmission system operators; and data on expected commercial flows of electricity interconnections between bidding zones connected to the United Kingdom and other bidding zones in the Union, as determined by Union transmission system operators using robust methodologies.

(b)

(c)

(d)

This process shall be compatible with the specific characteristics of direct current electricity interconnectors, including losses and ramping requirements. 4. The market coupling function shall: (a) produce results sufficiently in advance of the operation of the Parties' respective day-ahead markets (for the Union this is single day-ahead coupling established in accordance with

Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222135) in order that such results may be used as inputs into the processes which determine the results in those markets; (b) (c) produce results which are reliable and repeatable; be a specific process to link the distinct and separate day-ahead markets in the Union and the United Kingdom; in particular, this means that the specific algorithm shall be distinct and separate from that used in single day-ahead coupling established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 and, in respect of commercial bids and offers of the Union, only have access to those from bidding zones which are directly connected to the United Kingdom by an electricity interconnector.

5. The calculated net energy positions shall be published following validation and verification. If the market coupling function is unable either to operate or to produce a result, electricity interconnector capacity shall be allocated by a fall-back process, and market participants shall be notified that the fall-back process will apply. 6. The costs of developing and implementing the technical procedures shall be equally shared between the relevant United Kingdom transmission system operators or other entities, on the one side, and relevant Union transmission system operators or other entities, on the other side, unless the Specialised Committee on Energy decides otherwise. Part 2 The timeline for the implementation of this Annex shall be from the entry into force of this Agreement, as follows: (a) within 3 months ­ cost benefit analysis and outline of proposals for technical procedures; (b) within 10 months ­ proposal for technical procedures; (c) within 15 months ­ entry into operation of technical procedures.

(b)

the environmental protection requirements for the civil aeronautical product that were in effect on the date of the application for the validation to the validating authority. The validating authority shall specify, when applicable, any: exemption to the applicable requirements; deviation from the applicable requirements; or compensating factors that provide an equivalent level of safety when applicable requirements are not complied with.

2. (a) (b) (c)

3. In addition to the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the validating authority shall specify any special condition to be applied if the related airworthiness codes, laws, regulations and administrative provisions do not contain adequate or appropriate safety requirements for the civil aeronautical product, because: (a) the civil aeronautical product has novel or unusual design features relative to the design practices on which the applicable airworthiness codes, laws, regulations and administrative provisions are based; the intended use of the civil aeronautical product is unconventional; or experience obtained from other, similar civil aeronautical products in service or civil aeronautical products having similar design features has shown that unsafe conditions may develop.

(b) (c)

4. When specifying exemptions, deviations, compensating factors or special conditions, the validating authority shall give due consideration to these applied by the certificating authority and they shall not be more demanding for the civil aeronautical products to be validated than they would be for its own similar products. The validating authority shall notify the certificating authority of any such exemptions, deviations, compensating factors or special conditions. Article 12: Level of involvement of the validating authority 1. The level of involvement of the validating authority of a Party during the validation process referred to in Article 9 [Validation process] and as detailed in the technical implementation procedures, shall be mainly determined by: (a) the experience and records of the competent authority of the other Party as certificating authority; the experience already gained by that validating authority during previous validation exercises with the competent authority of the other Party; the nature of the design to be validated; the performance and experience of the applicant with the validating authority; and the outcome of qualification requirements assessments referred to in Articles 28 [Qualification requirements for the acceptance of findings of compliance and certificates] and Article 29 [Continued qualifications of the competent authorities]. 792

Section 2. Posting of drivers Article 1 - Subject matter This Section lays down requirements for road haulage operators established in one of the Parties which, in the framework of the transport of goods, post drivers to the territory of the other Party in accordance with Article 3 of this Section. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural persons into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including measures necessary to protect the integrity of its borders and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across them, provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to the other Party under the terms of this Section. The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of certain countries and not for those of others shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under this Section. Nothing in this Section shall affect the application on the Union territory of the Union rules on the posting of drivers in road transport to Union road haulage operators. Article 2 - Definitions For the purposes of this Section, "posted driver" means a driver who, for a limited period, carries out his or her work in the territory of a Party other than the Party in which the driver normally works. Article 3 - Principles 1. The provisions of this Section apply to the extent that the road haulage operator posts drivers to the territory of the other Party on its account and under its direction, under a contract concluded between the road haulage operator making the posting and the party for whom the transport services are intended, and those drivers operate in the territory of that Party, provided that there is an employment relationship between the road haulage operator making the posting and the driver during the period of posting. 2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, a posting shall be considered to start when the driver enters the territory of the other Party for the loading and/or unloading of goods and to end when the driver leaves the territory of that Party. For the purposes of paragraph 1, in the case of posting in the Union, a posting shall, be considered to start when the driver enters the territory of a Member State for the loading and/or unloading of goods in that Member State and to end when the driver leaves the territory of that Member State. 3. Notwithstanding the paragraphs 1 and 2, a driver shall not be considered to be posted when performing transport operations, based on a transport contract, as defined in point (a) of Article ROAD.4(1) [Transport of goods between, through and within the territories of the Parties] of this Agreement. 4. A driver shall not be considered to be posted in the United Kingdom where the driver transits through the territory of the United Kingdom without loading or unloading of goods. For the Union, a driver shall not be considered to be posted in a Member State when the driver transits through the territory of that Member State without loading or unloading of goods.

Article 5 - Improved access to information 1. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall publish the information on the terms and conditions of employment, in accordance with national law and/or practice, without undue delay and in a transparent manner, on a single official national website, including the constituent elements of remuneration as referred to in Article 4(2) and all the terms and conditions of employment in accordance with Article 4(1). Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall ensure that the information provided on the single official national website is accurate and up to date. 2. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall take the appropriate measures to ensure that the information mentioned in paragraph 1 is made generally available free of charge in a clear, transparent, comprehensive and easily accessible way at a distance and by electronic means, in formats and in accordance with web accessibility standards that ensure access to persons with disabilities and to ensure that competent national bodies are in a position to carry out their tasks effectively. 3.

The relevant information should, in particular, cover the different minimum rates of pay and their constituent elements, the method used to calculate the remuneration due and, where relevant, the qualifying criteria for classification in the different wage categories. 4. Where, contrary to paragraph 1, the information on the single official national website does not indicate which terms and conditions of employment are to be applied, that circumstance shall be taken into account in accordance with national law and/or practice in determining penalties in the event of infringements to this Section, to the extent necessary to ensure the proportionality of those penalties. 5.

rational driving based on safety regulations, in particular with regard to vehicle handling in different road conditions and the way they change with different atmospheric conditions, the time of day or night, and the ability to optimise fuel consumption. A Party and, in the case of the Union, a Member State may allow part of the training to be delivered by the approved training centre by means of ICT tools, such as e-learning, while ensuring that the high quality and the effectiveness of the training are maintained, and by selecting the subjects where ICT tools can most effectively be deployed. Reliable user identification and appropriate means of control shall be required in such a case. For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B the length of the initial qualification must be 70 hours, including five hours of individual driving. At the end of that training, the competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them shall give the driver a written or oral test. The test must include at least one question on each of the objectives in the list of subjects under Section 1 of this Appendix. 2.2 Option involving a test

The competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them shall organise the aforementioned theoretical and practical tests to check whether the trainee driver has the level of knowledge required in Section 1 of this Appendix for the subjects and objectives listed there. (a) The theoretical test shall consist of at least two parts: (i) (ii) questions including multiple-choice questions, questions requiring a direct answer, or a combination of both; and case studies.

The minimum duration of the theoretical test must be four hours. (b) The practical test shall consist of two parts: (i) a driving test aimed at assessing training in rational driving based on safety regulations. The test must take place, whenever possible, on roads outside built-up areas, on fast roads and on motorways (or similar), and on all kinds of urban highways presenting the different types of difficulties that a driver is liable to encounter. It would be desirable for that test to take place in different traffic density conditions. The driving time on the road must be used optimally in order to assess the candidate in all traffic areas likely to be encountered. The minimum duration of that test must be 90 minutes; a practical test covering at least points 1.5, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5 of Section 1 of this Appendix.

(ii)

The minimum duration of that test must be 30 minutes. The vehicle used for the practical test must meet at least the requirements for test vehicles. The practical test may be supplemented by a third test taking place on special terrain or on a top-of the-range simulator so as to assess training in rational driving based on safety regulations, in particular 834

with regard to vehicle handling in different road conditions and the way they change with different atmospheric conditions and the time of day or night. The duration of that optional test is not fixed. Should the driver undergo such a test, its duration may be deducted from the 90 minutes of the driving test referred to under (i), but the time deducted may not exceed 30 minutes. For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B, the theoretical test must be limited to the subjects, referred to in Section 1 of this Appendix, which are relevant to the vehicles to which the new initial qualification applies. However, such drivers must undergo the whole practical test. Section 3: Accelerated initial qualification provided for in Article 3(2) of Section 1 of Part B of Annex ROAD.1 Accelerated initial qualification must include the teaching of all subjects in the list in Section 1 of this Appendix. Its duration must be 140 hours. Each trainee driver must drive for at least 10 hours individually in a vehicle of the category concerned which meets at least the requirements for test vehicles. When driving individually, the trainee driver must be accompanied by an instructor, employed by an approved training centre. Each trainee driver may drive for a maximum of four hours of the 10 hours of individual driving on special terrain or on a top-of-the-range simulator so as to assess training in rational driving based on safety regulations, in particular with regard to vehicle handling in different road conditions and the way those road conditions change with different atmospheric conditions, the time of day or night, and the ability to optimise fuel consumption. The provisions of the fourth paragraph of point 2.1 of Section 2 of this Appendix shall also apply to the accelerated initial qualification. For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B, the length of the accelerated initial qualification must be 35 hours, including two-and-a-half hours of individual driving. At the end of that training, the competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them shall give the driver a written or oral test. The test must include at least one question on each of the objectives in the list of subjects under Section 1 of this Appendix. A Party may count specific other training related to the transport of goods by road required under its legislation as part of the training under this Section. Section 4: Compulsory periodic training provided for in point (b) of Article 3(1) of Section 1 of Part B of Annex ROAD.1 Compulsory periodic training courses must be organised by an approved training centre. Their duration must be of 35 hours every five years, given in periods of at least seven hours, which may be split over two consecutive days. Whenever e- learning is used, the approved training centre shall ensure that the proper quality of the training is maintained, including by selecting the subjects where ICT tools can most effectively be deployed. In particular, the Parties shall require reliable user identification and appropriate means of control. The maximum duration of the e-learning training shall not exceed 12 hours. At least one of the training course periods shall cover a road safety related subject. The content of the training shall take into account training needs specific to the transport operations carried out by the driver and relevant legal and technological developments and should, 835

as far as possible, take into account specific training needs of the driver. A range of different subjects should be covered over the 35 hours, including repeat training where it is shown that the driver needs specific remedial training. A Party and, in the case of the Union, a Member State may count specific other training related to the transport of goods by road required under its legislation as part of the training under this Section. Section 5: Approval of the initial qualification and periodic training 5.1. The training centres taking part in the initial qualification and periodic training must be approved by the competent authorities in the Parties. Approval may be given only in response to a written application. The application must be accompanied by documents including: 5.1.1. a suitable qualification and training programme specifying the subjects taught and setting out the proposed implementing plan and teaching methods; 5.1.2. the instructors' qualifications and fields of activity; 5.1.3. information about the premises where the courses are given, the teaching materials, the resources made available for the practical work, and the vehicle fleet used; 5.1.4. the conditions regarding participation in the courses (number of participants). 5.2.

Article 12 - Enforcement measures 1. Each Party shall adopt all appropriate measures to ensure observance of the provisions of Section 2 to 4 of Part B, in particular by ensuring annually an adequate level of roadside checks and checks performed at the premises of undertakings covering a large and representative cross-section of mobile workers, drivers, undertakings and vehicles of all transport categories falling within the scope of those Sections. The competent authorities in each Party shall organise the checks so that: (i) (ii) during each calendar year, a minimum of 3% of the days worked by the drivers of vehicles falling within the scope of Section 2 of Part B applies shall be checked; and at least 30% of the total number of working days checked shall be checked at the roadside and at least 50% at the premises of undertakings.

The elements of roadside checks shall include: (i) (ii) daily and weekly driving periods, interruptions and daily and weekly rest periods; the record sheets of the preceding days, which shall be on board the vehicle, and/or the data stored for the same period on the driver card and/or in the memory of the tachograph and/or on the printouts, when required; and the correct functioning of the tachograph.

(iii)

Those checks shall be carried out without discrimination among vehicles, undertakings and drivers whether resident or not, and regardless of the origin or destination of the journey or type of tachograph. The elements of checks on the premises of undertakings shall include, in addition to the elements subject to roadside checks: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) weekly rest periods and driving periods between those rest periods; fortnightly driving limits; compensation for reduced weekly rest periods in accordance with Article 6(6) and 6(7) of Section 2 of Part B; and use of record sheets and/or vehicle unit and driver card data and printouts and/or the organisation of drivers' working time.

2. If the findings of a roadside check on the driver of a vehicle registered in the territory of the other Party provide grounds to believe that infringements have been committed which cannot be detected during the check due to lack of necessary data, the competent authorities in each Party shall assist each other to clarify the situation. In cases where, to that end, the competent authorities in a Party carry out a check at the premises of the undertaking, the results of that check shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the other Party. 3. The competent authorities in the Parties shall work in cooperation with each other in the organisation of concerted roadside checks.

Article 9 - Issuing of driver cards 1. Driver cards shall be issued, at the request of the driver, by the competent authority in a Party where the driver has his normal residence. Where the competent authorities in a Party issuing the driver card have doubts as to the validity of a statement as to normal residence, or for the purpose of certain specific controls, they may request any additional information or evidence from the driver. For the purposes of this Article, "normal residence" means the place where a person usually lives, that is for at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal and occupational ties, or, in the case of a person with no occupational ties, because of personal ties which show close links between that person and the place where he is living. However, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a place different from their personal ties and who consequently lives in turn in different places situated in the two Parties shall be regarded as being the place of their personal ties, provided that such person returns there regularly. This last condition need not be complied with where the person is living in a Party in order to carry out a fixed-term assignment. 2. In duly justified and exceptional cases, each Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State may issue a temporary and non-renewable driver card valid for a maximum period of 185 days to a driver who does not have his normal residence in a Party, provided that such driver is in a labour law relationship with an undertaking established in the issuing Party and, in so far, presents a driver attestation when required. 3. The competent authorities of the issuing Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that an applicant does not already hold a valid driver card and shall personalise the driver card, ensuring that its data are visible and secure. 4. The driver card shall not be valid for more than five years.

4.

5. A valid driver card shall not be withdrawn or suspended unless the competent authorities of a Party find that the card has been falsified, or the driver is using a card of which he is not the holder, or the card held has been obtained on the basis of false declarations and/or forged documents. If such suspension or withdrawal measures are taken by a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State other than the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, other than the issuing Member State, the former shall return the card to the authorities of the Party or, in the case of the Union, the authorities of the Member State which issued it, as soon as possible, indicating the reasons for the withdrawal or suspension. If the return of the card is expected to take longer than two weeks, the suspending or withdrawing Party or, in the case of the Union, the suspending or withdrawing Member State shall inform the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, the issuing Member State within those two weeks of the reasons for suspension or withdrawal.

This Article shall not prevent a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State from issuing a driver card to a driver who has his normal residence in a part of that Party's territory, to which this Annex does not apply, provided that the relevant provisions of this Section are applied in such cases. Article 10 - Renewal of driver cards

1. Where, in the case of renewals, the Party of the driver's normal residence is different from that which
issued his current card, and where the authorities of the former Party are requested to renew the driver card, they shall inform the authorities which issued the earlier card of the reasons for its renewal.

2. In the event of a request for the renewal of a card which is imminently about to expire, the competent
authority shall supply a new card before the expiry date, provided that the request was sent within the time-limits laid down in Article 5 of Section 4 of Part B of this Annex. Article 11 - Stolen, lost or defective driver cards

1.

Issuing authorities shall keep records of issued, stolen, lost or defective driver cards for a period at least equivalent to their period of validity. If the driver card is damaged, malfunctions or is lost or stolen, the competent authorities in the Party of his normal residence shall supply a replacement card within eight working days after their receipt of a detailed request to that effect. Article 12 - Mutual acceptance of driver cards

2.

1. Each Party shall accept the driver cards issued by the other Party. 2. Where the holder of a valid driver card issued by a Party has established his normal residence in
the other Party and has asked for his card to be exchanged for an equivalent driver card, it shall be the responsibility of the Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State which carries out the exchange to verify whether the card produced is still valid.

3. Parties or, in the case of the Union, Member States carrying out an exchange shall return the old
card to the authorities of the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, the issuing Member State and indicate the reasons for so doing.

4. Where a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State replaces or exchanges a driver card,
the replacement or exchange, and any subsequent replacement or exchange, shall be registered in that Party or, in the case of the Union, in that Member State.

the Union, Member States shall maintain national electronic registers containing the following information on driver cards for a period at least equivalent to the period of validity of those cards: -- surname and first name of the driver; -- -- -- -- birth date and, if available, place of birth of the driver; valid driving licence number and country of issue of the driving licence (if applicable); status of the driver card; and driver card number.

2. The electronic registers of the Parties or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall be
interconnected and accessible throughout the territory of the Parties, using the TACHOnet messaging system or a compatible system. In the case of the use of a compatible system, the exchange of electronic data with the other Party shall be possible through the TACHOnet messaging system.

3. When issuing, replacing and, where necessary, renewing a driver card, Parties or, in the case of the
Union, Member States shall verify through electronic data exchange that the driver does not already hold another valid driver card. The data exchanged shall be limited to the data necessary for the purpose of this verification.

4. Control officers may have access to the electronic register in order to check the status of a driver card.
Article 14 - Settings of tachographs

1. Digital tachographs shall not be set in such a way that they automatically switch to a specific category
of activity when the vehicle's engine or ignition is switched off, unless the driver remains able to choose manually the appropriate category of activity.

2. Vehicles shall not be fitted with more than one tachograph, except for the purposes of field tests. 3. Each Party shall forbid the production, distribution, advertising and/or selling of devices constructed
and/or intended for the manipulation of tachographs. Article 15 - Responsibility of road haulage operators

The receiving State shall be notified without delay if it transpires ex officio, or from a notification by the data subject, that incorrect data or data which should not have been supplied have been supplied. The State(s) concerned shall be obliged to correct or delete the data. Moreover, personal data supplied shall be corrected if they are found to be incorrect. If the receiving body has reason to believe that the supplied data are incorrect or should be deleted, the supplying body shall be informed forthwith. 2. Data, the accuracy of which the data subject contests and the accuracy or inaccuracy of which cannot be established shall, in accordance with the domestic law of the States, be marked with a flag at the request of the data subject. If a flag exists, this may be removed subject to the domestic law of the States and only with the permission of the data subject or on the basis of a decision of the competent court or independent data protection authority. 3. Personal data supplied which should not have been supplied or received shall be deleted. Data which are lawfully supplied and received shall be deleted: (a) if they are not or no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were supplied; if personal data have been supplied without request, the receiving body shall immediately check if they are necessary for the purposes for which they were supplied; following the expiry of the maximum period for keeping data laid down in the domestic law of the supplying State, where the supplying body informed the receiving body of that maximum period at the time of supplying the data.

(b)

4. Where there is reason to believe that deletion would prejudice the interests of the data subject, the data shall be blocked instead of being deleted in compliance with domestic law. Blocked data may be supplied or used solely for the purpose which prevented their deletion. Article 18: Technical and organisational measures to ensure data protection and data security 1. The supplying and receiving bodies shall take steps to ensure that personal data is effectively protected against accidental or unauthorised destruction, accidental loss, unauthorised access, unauthorised or accidental alteration and unauthorised disclosure. 2. The features of the technical specification of the automated search procedure are regulated in the implementing measures as referred to in Article LAW.PRUM.17 [Implementing measures] which guarantee that: (a) state-of-the-art technical measures are taken to ensure data protection and data security, in particular data confidentiality and integrity; encryption and authorisation procedures recognised by the competent authorities are used when having recourse to generally accessible networks; and 905

the admissibility of searches in accordance with paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 of Article 19 of this Chapter can be checked.

Article 19: Logging and recording: special rules governing automated and non-automated supply 1. Each State shall guarantee that every non-automated supply and every non-automated receipt of personal data by the body administering the file and by the searching body is logged in order to verify the admissibility of the supply. Logging shall contain the following information: (a) (b) (c) (d) the reason for the supply; the data supplied; the date of the supply; and the name or reference code of the searching body and of the body administering the file.

2. The following shall apply to automated searches for data based on Articles LAW.PRUM.8 [Automated searching of DNA profiles], LAW.PRUM.12 [Automated searching of dactyloscopic data] and LAW.PRUM.15 [Automated searching of vehicle registration data] and to automated comparison pursuant to Article LAW.PRUM.9 [Automated comparison of DNA profiles]: (a) only specially authorised officers of the national contact points may carry out automated searches or comparisons; the list of officers authorised to carry out automated searches or comparisons shall be made available upon request to the supervisory authorities referred to in paragraph 6 and to the other States; each State shall ensure that each supply and receipt of personal data by the body administering the file and the searching body is recorded, including notification of whether or not a HIT exists; recording shall include the following information: (i) (ii) (iii) the data supplied; the date and exact time of the supply; and the name or reference code of the searching body and of the body administering the file.

(b)

3. The searching body shall also record the reason for the search or supply as well as an identifier for the official who carried out the search and the official who ordered the search or supply. 4. The recording body shall immediately communicate the recorded data upon request to the competent data protection authorities of the relevant State at the latest within four weeks following receipt of the request; recorded data may be used solely for the following purposes: (a) (b) monitoring data protection; ensuring data security. 906

5. The recorded data shall be protected with suitable measures against inappropriate use and other forms of improper use and shall be kept for two years. After the conservation period, the recorded data shall be deleted immediately. 6. Responsibility for legal checks on the supply or receipt of personal data lies with the independent data protection authorities or, as appropriate, the judicial authorities of the respective States. Anyone can request those authorities to check the lawfulness of the processing of data in respect of their person in compliance with domestic law. Independently of such requests, those authorities and the bodies responsible for recording shall carry out random checks on the lawfulness of supply, based on the files involved. 7. The results of such checks shall be kept for inspection for 18 months by the independent data protection authorities. After that period, they shall be immediately deleted. Each data protection authority may be requested by the independent data protection authority of another State to exercise its powers in accordance with domestic law. The independent data protection authorities of the States shall perform the inspection tasks necessary for mutual cooperation, in particular by exchanging relevant information. Article 20: Data subjects' rights to damages Where a body of one State has supplied personal data under Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three, the receiving body of the other State cannot use the inaccuracy of the data supplied as grounds to evade its liability vis-à-vis the injured party under domestic law. If damages are awarded against the receiving body because of its use of inaccurate transfer data, the body which supplied the data shall refund the amount paid in damages to the receiving body in full. Article 21: Information requested by the States The receiving State shall inform the supplying State on request of the processing of supplied data and the result obtained. Article 22: Declarations and designations 1. The United Kingdom shall communicate its declarations pursuant to Article LAW.PRUM 7(3) [Establishment of domestic DNA analysis files], and Article 12(1) of this Chapter, as well as its designations pursuant to Articles LAW.PRUM 13(1) [National contact points], and LAW.PRUM 15(3) [Automated searching of vehicle registration data] to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation. 2. Factual information provided by the United Kingdom through these declarations and designations, and by Member States in accordance with Article LAW.PRUM 17(3) [Implementing measures], are included in the Manual as referred to in Article 18(2) of Decision 2008/616/JHA. 3. States may amend declarations and designations submitted in accordance with paragraph 1 at any time by means of a notification submitted to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement 907

and Judicial Cooperation. The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall forward any declarations received to the General Secretariat of the Council. 4. The General Secretariat of the Council shall communicate any changes in the Manual referred to in paragraph 2 to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation. Article 23: Preparation of decisions as referred to in Article LAW.PRUM.18 [Ex ante evaluation] 1. The Council shall take a decision as referred to in Article LAW.PRUM.18 [Ex ante evaluation] on the basis of an evaluation report which shall be based on a questionnaire. 2. With respect to the automated data exchange in accordance with Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three, the evaluation report shall also be based on an evaluation visit and a pilot run that shall be carried out if required when the United Kingdom has informed the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that they have implemented the obligations imposed on them under Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three and submit the declarations provided for in Article 22 of this Chapter. Further details of the procedure are set out in Chapter 4 of this Annex. Article 24: Statistics and reporting 1. An evaluation of the administrative, technical and financial application of the data exchange pursuant to Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three shall be carried out on a regular basis. The evaluation shall be carried out with respect to the data categories for which data exchange has started among the States concerned. The evaluation shall be based on reports of the respective States. 2. Each State shall compile statistics on the results of the automated data exchange. In order to ensure comparability, the model for statistics will be compiled by the relevant Council Working Group. These statistics will be forwarded annually to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation. 3. In addition, States will be requested on a regular basis not to exceed once per year to provide further information on the administrative, technical and financial implementation of automated data exchange as needed to analyse and improve the process. 4. Statistics and reporting made by Member States in accordance with Decisions 2008/615/JHA and 2008/616/JHA shall apply in relation to this Article. CHAPTER 1: Exchange of DNA-data 1. 1.1.

The seven grey loci in the top row are both the present ESS and the ISSOL. Inclusion Rules: The DNA-profiles made available by the States for searching and comparison as well as the DNAprofiles sent out for searching and comparison shall contain at least six full designated147 loci and may contain additional loci or blanks depending on their availability. The reference DNA profiles shall contain at least six of the seven ESS of loci. In order to raise the accuracy of matches, all available alleles shall be stored in the indexed DNA profile database and be used for searching and comparison. Each State should implement as soon as practically possible any new ESS of loci adopted by the EU. Mixed profiles are not allowed, so that the allele values of each locus will consist of only two numbers, which may be the same in the case of homozygosity at a given locus. Wild-cards and Micro-variants are to be dealt with using the following rules: ­ Any non-numerical value except amelogenin contained in the profile (e.g. `o', `f', `r', `na', `nr' or `un') has to be automatically converted for the export to a wild card (*) and searched against all, Numerical values `0', `1' or `99' contained in the profile have to be automatically converted for the export to a wild card (*) and searched against all, If three alleles are provided for one locus the first allele will be accepted and the remaining two alleles have to be automatically converted for the export to a wild card (*) and searched against all, When wild card values are provided for allele 1 or 2 then both permutations of the numerical value given for the locus will be searched (e.g. 12, * could match against 12,14 or 9,12), Pentanucleotide (Penta D, Penta E and CD4) micro-variants will be matched according to the following: x.1 = x, x.1, x.2

The comparison of two DNA-profiles will be performed on the basis of the loci for which a pair of allele values is available in both DNA-profiles. At least six full designated loci (exclusive of amelogenin) must match between both DNA-profiles before a HIT response is provided. A full match (Quality 1) is defined as a match, when all allele values of the compared loci commonly contained in the requesting and requested DNA-profiles are the same. A near match is defined as a match, when the value of only one of all the compared alleles is different in the two DNA profiles (Quality 2, 3 and 4). A near match is only accepted if there are at least six full designated matched loci in the two compared DNA profiles. The reason for a near match may be: ­ a human typing error at the point of entry of one of the DNA-profiles in the search request or the DNA-database, an allele-determination or allele-calling error during the generation procedure of the DNAprofile.

When a State receives a report of a match, its national contact point is responsible for comparing the values of the profile submitted as a question and the values of the profile(s) received as an answer to validate and check the evidential value of the profile. National contact points can contact each other directly for validation purposes. Legal assistance procedures start after validation of an existing match between two profiles, on the basis of a `full match' or a `near match' obtained during the automated consultation phase. 4. 4.1. DNA interface control document Introduction

4.1.1. Objectives This Chapter defines the requirements for the exchange of DNA profile information between the DNA database systems of all States. The header fields are defined specifically for the Prüm DNA exchange; the data part is based on the DNA profile data part in the XML schema defined for the Interpol DNA exchange gateway. Data are exchanged by Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and other state-of-the-art technologies, using a central relay mail server provided by the network provider. The XML file is transported as mail body. 4.1.2. Scope This ICD defines the content of the message (or `mail') only. All network-specific and mail-specific topics are defined uniformly in order to allow a common technical base for the DNA data exchange. This includes: ­ the format of the subject field in the message to enable/allow for an automated processing of the messages, whether content encryption is necessary and if yes which methods should be chosen, the maximum length of messages.

­ ­

4.1.3. XML structure and principles The XML message is structured into: ­ ­ the header part, which contains information about the transmission, and the data part, which contains profile specific information, as well as the profile itself.

The same XML schema shall be used for request and response. For the purpose of complete checks of unidentified DNA profiles, as provided for in Article LAW.PRUM.9 [Automated comparison of DNA profiles], it shall be possible to send a batch of profiles 912

5.1.

Overview

In implementing applications for the DNA data exchange within the framework of Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three, a common communication network shall be used, which will be logically closed among the States. In order to exploit this common communication infrastructure of sending requests and receiving replies in a more effective way, an asynchronous mechanism to convey DNA and dactyloscopic data requests in a wrapped SMTP e-mail message is adopted. In fulfilment of security concerns, the mechanism s/MIME as extension to the SMTP functionality will be used to establish a true end-to-end secure tunnel over the network. The operational Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) is used as the communication network for data exchange among the States. TESTA is under the responsibility of the European Commission. Taking into account that national DNA databases and the current national access points of TESTA may be located on different sites in the States, access to TESTA may be set up either by: 1. using the existing national access point or establishing a new national TESTA access point; or 2. setting up a secure local link from the site where the DNA database is located and managed by the competent national agency to the existing national TESTA access point. The protocols and standards deployed in the implementation of Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three applications comply with the open standards and meet the requirements imposed by national security policy makers of the States. 5.2. Upper Level Architecture

In the scope of Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three, each State will make its DNA data available to be exchanged with and/or searched by other States in conformity with the standardised common data format. The architecture is based upon an any-to-any communication model. There exists neither a central computer server nor a centralised database to hold DNA profiles.

In addition to the fulfilment of domestic legal constraints at States' sites, each State may decide what kind of hardware and software should be deployed for the configuration at its site to comply with the requirements set out in Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three. 5.3. Security Standards and Data Protection

Three levels of security concerns have been considered and implemented. 5.3.1. Data Level DNA profile data provided by each State shall have to be prepared in compliance with a common data protection standard, so that requesting States will receive an answer mainly to indicate HIT or No-HIT along with an identification number in case of a HIT, which does not contain any personal information. The further investigation after the notification of a HIT will be conducted at bilateral level pursuant to the existing domestic legal and organisational regulations of the respective States' sites. 5.3.2. Communication Level Messages containing DNA profile information (requesting and replying) will be encrypted by means of a state-of-the-art mechanism in conformity with open standards, such as s/MIME, before they are forwarded to the sites of other States. 5.3.3. Transmission Level All encrypted messages containing DNA profile information will be forwarded onto other States' sites through a virtual private tunnelling system administered by a trusted network provider at the international level and the secure links to this tunnelling system under national responsibility. This virtual private tunnelling system does not have a connection point with the open Internet. 920

5.4.

Protocols and Standards to be used for encryption mechanism: s/MIME and related packages

The open standard s/MIME as extension to de facto e-mail standard SMTP will be deployed to encrypt messages containing DNA profile information. The protocol s/MIME (V3) allows signed receipts, security labels, and secure mailing lists and is layered on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specification for cryptographic protected messages. It can be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate or encrypt any form of digital data. The underlying certificate used by the s/MIME mechanism has to be in compliance with X.509 standard. In order to ensure common standards and procedures with other Prüm applications, the processing rules for s/MIME encryption operations or to be applied under various Commercial Product of the Shelves (COTS) environments, are as follows: ­ ­ the sequence of the operations is: first encryption and then signing, the encryption algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256 bit key length and RSA with 1024 bit key length shall be applied for symmetric and asymmetric encryption respectively, the hash algorithm SHA-1 shall be applied.

­

s/MIME functionality is built into the vast majority of modern e-mail software packages including Outlook, Mozilla Mail as well as Netscape Communicator 4.x and inter-operates among all major email software packages. Because of s/MIME's easy integration into national IT infrastructure at all States' sites, it is selected as a viable mechanism to implement the communication security level. For achieving the goal 'Proof of Concept' in a more efficient way and reducing costs the open standard JavaMail API is however chosen for prototyping DNA data exchange. JavaMail API provides simple encryption and decryption of emails using s/MIME and/or OpenPGP. The intent is to provide a single, easy-to-use API for e-mail clients that want to send and receive encrypted e-mail in either of the two most popular e-mail encryption formats. Therefore any state-of-the-art implementations to JavaMail API will suffice for the requirements set by Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three, such as the product of Bouncy Castle JCE (Java Cryptographic Extension), which will be used to implement s/MIME for prototyping DNA data exchange among all States. 5.5. Application Architecture

Each State will provide the other States with a set of standardised DNA profile data which are in conformity with the current common ICD. This can be done either by providing a logical view over individual national database or by establishing a physical exported database (indexed database). The four main components: E-mail server/s/MIME, Application Server, Data Structure Area for fetching/feeding data and registering incoming/outgoing messages, and Match Engine implement the whole application logic in a product-independent way. In order to provide all States with an easy integration of the components into their respective national sites, the specified common functionality has been implemented by means of open source components, which could be selected by each State depending on its national IT policy and regulations. Because of the independent features to be implemented to get access to indexed 921

databases containing DNA profiles covered by Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three, each State can freely select its hardware and software platform, including database and operating systems. A prototype for the DNA Data Exchange has been developed and successfully tested over the existing common network. The version 1.0 has been deployed in the productive environment and is used for daily operations. States may use the jointly developed product but may also develop their own products. The common product components will be maintained, customised and further developed according to changing IT, forensic and/or functional police requirements. Figure 2: Overview Application Topology

Protocols and Standards to be used for application architecture:

5.6.1. XML The DNA data exchange will fully exploit XML-schema as attachment to SMTP e-mail messages. The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a W3C-recommended general-purpose markup language for creating special-purpose markup languages, capable of describing many different kinds of data. The description of the DNA profile suitable for exchange among all States has been done by means of XML and XML schema in the ICD document. 5.6.2. ODBC Open DataBase Connectivity provides a standard software API method for accessing database management systems and making it independent of programming languages, database and operating systems. ODBC has, however, certain drawbacks. Administering a large number of client machines can involve a diversity of drivers and DLLs. This complexity can increase system administration overhead. 5.6.3. JDBC Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) is an API for the Java programming language that defines how a client may access a database. In contrast to ODBC, JDBC does not require to use a certain set of local DLLs at the Desktop.

The business logic of processing DNA profile requests and replies at each States' site is described in the following diagram. Both requesting and replying flows interact with a neutral data area comprising different data pools with a common data structure. Figure 3: Overview Application Workflow at each State's site

Communication Environment

5.7.1. Common Communication Network: TESTA and its follow-up infrastructure The application DNA data exchange will exploit the e-mail, an asynchronous mechanism, to send requests and to receive replies among the States. As all States have at least one national access point to the TESTA network, the DNA data exchange will be deployed over the TESTA network. TESTA provides a number of added-value services through its e-mail relay. In addition to hosting TESTA specific e-mail boxes, the infrastructure can implement mail distribution lists and routing policies. This allows TESTA to be used as a clearing house for messages addressed to administrations connected to the EU wide Domains. Virus check mechanisms may also be put in place. The TESTA e-mail relay is built on a high availability hardware platform located at the central TESTA application facilities and protected by firewall. The TESTA Domain Name Systems (DNS) will resolve resource locators to IP addresses and hide addressing issues from the user and from applications. 5.7.2. Security Concern The concept of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) has been implemented within the framework of TESTA. Tag Switching Technology used to build this VPN will evolve to support Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) standard developed by the IETF.

MPLS is an IETF standard technology that speeds up network traffic flow by avoiding packet analysis by intermediate routers (hops). This is done on the basis of so-called labels that are attached to packet by the edge routers of the backbone, on the basis of information stored in the forwarding information base (FIB). Labels are also used to implement VPNs. MPLS combines the benefits of layer 3 routing with the advantages of layer 2 switching. Because IP addresses are not evaluated during transition through the backbone, MPLS does not impose any IP addressing limitations. Furthermore, e-mail messages over the TESTA will be protected by s/MIME driven encryption mechanism. Without knowing the key and possessing the right certificate, nobody can decrypt messages over the network. 5.7.3. Protocols and Standards to be used over the communication network 5.7.3.1. SMTP SMTP is the de facto standard for e-mail transmission across the Internet. SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, where one or more recipients of a message are specified and then the message text is transferred. SMTP uses TCP port 25 upon the specification by the IETF. To determine the SMTP server for a given domain name, the MX (Mail eXchange) DNS (Domain Name Systems) record is used. Since this protocol started as purely ASCII text-based it did not deal well with binary files. Standards such as MIME were developed to encode binary files for transfer through SMTP. Today, most SMTP servers support the 8BITMIME and s/MIME extension, permitting binary files to be transmitted almost as easily as plain text. The processing rules for s/MIME operations are described in the section s/MIME (see Section 5.4).

SMTP is a `push' protocol that does not allow one to `pull' messages from a remote server on demand. To do this a mail client shall use POP3 or IMAP. Within the framework of implementing DNA data exchange it is decided to use the protocol POP3. 5.7.3.2. POP Local e-mail clients use the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), an application-layer Internet standard protocol, to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP/IP connection. By using the SMTP Submit profile of the SMTP protocol, e-mail clients send messages across the Internet or over a corporate network. MIME serves as the standard for attachments and non-ASCII text in e-mail. Although neither POP3 nor SMTP requires MIME-formatted e-mail, essentially Internet e-mail comes MIME-formatted, so POP clients must also understand and use MIME. The whole communication environment of Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three will therefore include the components of POP. 5.7.4. Network Address Assignment Operative environment A dedicated block half B class subnet has currently been allocated by the European IP registration authority (RIPE) to TESTA. The assignment of IP addresses to States is based upon a geographical schema in Europe. The data exchange among States within the framework of Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data ] of Part Three is operated over a European wide logically closed IP network. Testing Environment In order to provide a smooth running environment for the daily operation among all connected States, it is necessary to establish a testing environment over the closed network for new States which prepare to join the operations. A sheet of parameters including IP addresses, network settings, e-mail domains as well as application user accounts has been specified and should be set up at the corresponding State's site. Moreover, a set of pseudo DNA profiles has been constructed for test purposes. 5.7.5. Configuration Parameters A secure e-mail system is set up using the eu-admin.net domain. That domain with the associated addresses will not be accessible from a location not on the TESTA EU wide domain, because the names are only known on the TESTA central DNS server, which is shielded from the Internet. The mapping of these TESTA site addresses (host names) to their IP addresses is done by the TESTA DNS service. For each Local Domain, a Mail entry will be added to this TESTA central DNS server, relaying all e-mail messages sent to TESTA Local Domains to the TESTA central Mail Relay. That TESTA central Mail Relay will then forward them to the specific Local Domain e-mail server using the Local Domain e-mail addresses. By relaying the e-mail in this way, critical information contained in e-mails will only pass the Europe-wide closed network infrastructure and not the insecure Internet. It is necessary to establish sub-domains (bold italics) at the sites of all States upon the following syntax: `application-type.State-code.pruem.testa.eu', where: 925

CHAPTER 2: Exchange of dactyloscopic data (interface control document) The purpose of the following document interface Control Document is to define the requirements for the exchange of dactyloscopic information between the Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) of the States. It is based on the Interpol-Implementation of ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 (INT-I, Version 4.22b). This version shall cover all basic definitions for Logical Records Type-1, Type-2, Type-4, Type-9, Type13 and Type-15 required for image- and minutiæ-based dactyloscopic processing. 1. File Content Overview

A dactyloscopic file consists of several logical records. There are sixteen types of record specified in the original ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 standard. Appropriate ASCII separation characters are used between each record and the fields and subfields within the records. Only 6 record types are used to exchange information between the originating and the destination agency: Type-1 Type-2 Type-4 Type-9 Type-13 Type-15       Transaction information Alphanumeric persons/case data High resolution greyscale dactyloscopic images Minutiæ Record Variable resolution latent image record Variable resolution palmprint image record

1.1.

Type-1 -- File header

This record contains routing information and information describing the structure of the rest of the file. This record type also defines the types of transaction which fall under the following broad categories: 933

1.2.

Type-2 -- Descriptive text

This record contains textual information of interest to the sending and receiving agencies. 1.3. Type-4 -- High resolution greyscale image

This record is used to exchange high resolution greyscale (eight bit) dactyloscopic images sampled at 500 pixels/inch. The dactyloscopic images shall be compressed using the WSQ algorithm with a ratio of not more than 15:1. Other compression algorithms or uncompressed images shall not be used. 1.4. Type-9 -- Minutiæ record

Type-9 records are used to exchange ridge characteristics or minutiæ data. Their purpose is partly to avoid unnecessary duplication of AFIS encoding processes and partly to allow the transmission of AFIS codes which contain less data than the corresponding images. 1.5. Type-13 -- Variable-Resolution Latent Image Record

This record shall be used to exchange variable-resolution latent fingerprint and latent palmprint images together with textural alphanumerical information. The scanning resolution of the images shall be 500 pixels/inch with 256 grey-levels. If the quality of the latent image is sufficient it shall be compressed using WSQ-algorithm. If necessary the resolution of the images may be expanded to more than 500 pixels/inch and more than 256 grey-levels by mutual agreement. In that case, it is strongly recommended to use JPEG 2000 (see Appendix 7). 1.6. Variable-Resolution Palmprint Image Record

Type-15 tagged field image records shall be used to exchange variable-resolution palmprint images together with textural alphanumerical information. The scanning resolution of the images shall be 500 pixels/inch with 256 grey-levels. To minimise the amount of data, all palmprint images shall be compressed using WSQ-algorithm. If necessary the resolution of the images may be expanded to more than 500 pixels/inch and more than 256 grey-levels by mutual agreement. In that case, it is strongly recommended to use JPEG 2000 (see Appendix 7). 2. Record format

A transaction file shall consist of one or more logical records. For each logical record contained in the file, several information fields appropriate to that record type shall be present. Each information field may contain one or more basic single-valued information items. Taken together these items are used to convey different aspects of the data contained in that field. An information field may also consist of one or more information items grouped together and repeated multiple times within a field. Such a group of information items is known as a subfield. An information field may therefore consist of one or more subfields of information items. 2.1. Information separators

In the tagged-field logical records, mechanisms for delimiting information are implemented by use of four ASCII information separators. The delimited information may be items within a field or subfield, fields within a logical record, or multiple occurrences of subfields. These information separators are defined in the standard ANSI X3.4. These characters are used to separate and qualify information in a 934

logical sense. Viewed in a hierarchical relationship, the File Separator `FS' character is the most inclusive followed by the Group Separator `GS', the Record Separator `RS', and finally the Unit Separator `US' characters. Table 1 lists these ASCII separators and a description of their use within this standard. Information separators should be functionally viewed as an indication of the type data that follows. The `US' character shall separate individual information items within a field or subfield. This is a signal that the next information item is a piece of data for that field or subfield. Multiple subfields within a field separated by the `RS' character signals the start of the next group of repeated information item(s). The `GS' separator character used between information fields signals the beginning of a new field preceding the field identifying number that shall appear. Similarly, the beginning of a new logical record shall be signalled by the appearance of the `FS' character. The four characters are only meaningful when used as separators of data items in the fields of the ASCII text records. There is no specific meaning attached to these characters occurring in binary image records and binary fields -- they are just part of the exchanged data. Normally, there should be no empty fields or information items and therefore only one separator character should appear between any two data items. The exception to this rule occurs for those instances where the data in fields or information items in a transaction are unavailable, missing, or optional, and the processing of the transaction is not dependent upon the presence of that particular data. In those instances, multiple and adjacent separator characters shall appear together rather than requiring the insertion of dummy data between separator characters. For the definition of a field that consists of three information items, the following applies. If the information for the second information item is missing, then two adjacent `US' information separator characters would occur between the first and third information items. If the second and third information items were both missing, then three separator characters should be used -- two `US' characters in addition to the terminating field or subfield separator character. In general, if one or more mandatory or optional information items are unavailable for a field or subfield, then the appropriate number of separator character should be inserted. It is possible to have side-by-side combinations of two or more of the four available separator characters. When data are missing or unavailable for information items, subfields, or fields, there shall be one separator character less than the number of data items, subfields, or fields required.

2.2.

Record layout

For tagged-field logical records, each information field that is used shall be numbered in accordance with this standard. The format for each field shall consist of the logical record type number followed by a period `.', a field number followed by a colon `:', followed by the information appropriate to that field. The tagged-field number can be any one-to-nine digit number occurring between the period `.' and the colon `:'. It shall be interpreted as an unsigned integer field number. This implies that a field number of `2.123:' is equivalent to and shall be interpreted in the same manner as a field number of `2.000000123:'. For purposes of illustration throughout this document, a three-digit number shall be used for enumerating the fields contained in each of the tagged-field logical records described herein. Field numbers will have the form of `TT.xxx:' where the `TT' represents the one- or two-character record type followed by a period. The next three characters comprise the appropriate field number followed by a colon. Descriptive ASCII information or the image data follows the colon. Logical Type-1 and Type-2 records contain only ASCII textual data fields. The entire length of the record (including field numbers, colons, and separator characters) shall be recorded as the first ASCII field within each of these record types. The ASCII File Separator `FS' control character (signifying the end of the logical record or transaction) shall follow the last byte of ASCII information and shall be included in the length of the record. In contrast to the tagged-field concept, the Type-4 record contains only binary data recorded as ordered fixed-length binary fields. The entire length of the record shall be recorded in the first fourbyte binary field of each record. For this binary record, neither the record number with its period, nor the field identifier number and its following colon, shall be recorded. Furthermore, as all the field lengths of this record is either fixed or specified, none of the four separator characters (`US', `RS', `GS', or `FS') shall be interpreted as anything other than binary data. For the binary record, the `FS' character shall not be used as a record separator or transaction terminating character. 3. Type-1 Logical Record: the File Header

This record describes the structure of the file, the type of the file, and other important information. The character set used for Type-1 fields shall contain only the 7-bit ANSI code for information interchange. 3.1. Fields for Type-1 Logical Record

3.1.1. Field 1.001: Logical Record Length (LEN) This field contains the total count of the number of bytes in the whole Type-1 logical record. The field begins with `1.001:', followed by the total length of the record including every character of every field and the information separators. 3.1.2. Field 1.002: Version Number (VER) To ensure that users know which version of the ANSI/NIST standard is being used, this four byte field specifies the version number of the standard being implemented by the software or system creating the file. The first two bytes specify the major version reference number, the second two the minor 936

revision number. For example, the original 1986 Standard would be considered the first version and designated `0100' while the present ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 standard is `0300'. 3.1.3. Field 1.003: File Content (CNT) This field lists each of the records in the file by record type and the order in which the records appear in the logical file. It consists of one or more subfields, each of which in turn contains two information items describing a single logical record found in the current file. The subfields are entered in the same order in which the records are recorded and transmitted. The first information item in the first subfield is `1', to refer to this Type-1 record. It is followed by a second information item which contains the number of other records contained in the file. This number is also equal to the count of the remaining subfields of field 1.003. Each of the remaining subfields is associated with one record within the file, and the sequence of subfields corresponds to the sequence of records. Each subfield contains two items of information. The first is to identify the Type of the record. The second is the record's IDC. The `US' character shall be used to separate the two information items. 3.1.4. Field 1.004: Type of Transaction (TOT) This field contains a three letter mnemonic designating the type of the transaction. These codes may be different from those used by other implementations of the ANSI/NIST standard. CPS: Criminal Print-to-Print Search. This transaction is a request for a search of a record relating to a criminal offence against a prints database. The person's prints shall be included as WSQ-compressed images in the file. In case of a No-HIT, the following logical records will be returned: ­ ­ 1 Type-1 Record, 1 Type-2 Record.

In case of a HIT, the following logical records will be returned: ­ ­ ­ 1 Type-1 Record, 1 Type-2 Record, 1-14 Type-4 Record.

The CPS TOT is summarised in Table A.6.1 (Appendix 6). PMS: Print-to-Latent Search. This transaction is used when a set of prints is searched against an Unidentified Latent database. The response will contain the HIT/No-HIT decision of the destination AFIS search. If multiple unidentified latents exist, multiple SRE transactions will be returned, with one latent per transaction. The person's prints shall be included as WSQ-compressed images in the file. In case of a No-HIT, the following logical records will be returned: 937

1 Type-1 Record, 1 Type-2 Record.

In case of a HIT, the following logical records will be returned: ­ ­ ­ 1 Type-1 Record, 1 Type-2 Record, 1 Type-13 Record.

The PMS TOT is summarised in Table A.6.1 (Appendix 6). MPS: Latent-to-Print Search. This transaction is used when a latent is to be searched against a Prints database. The latent minutiæ information and the image (WSQ-compressed) shall be included in the file. In case of a No-HIT, the following logical records will be returned: ­ ­ 1 Type-1 Record, 1 Type-2 Record.

In case of a HIT, the following logical records will be returned: ­ ­ ­ 1 Type-1 Record, 1 Type-2 Record, 1 Type-4 or Type-15 Record.

The MPS TOT is summarised in Table A.6.4 (Appendix 6). MMS: Latent-to-Latent Search.

3.1.5. Field 1.005: Date of Transaction (DAT) This field indicates the date on which the transaction was initiated and shall conform to the ISO standard notation of: YYYYMMDD where YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is the day of the month. Leading zeros are used for single figure numbers. For example, `19931004' represents 4 October 1993. 3.1.6. Field 1.006: Priority (PRY) This optional field defines the priority, on a level of 1 to 9, of the request. `1' is the highest priority and `9' the lowest. Priority `1' transactions shall be processed immediately. 3.1.7. Field 1.007: Destination Agency Identifier (DAI) This field specifies the destination agency for the transaction. It consists of two information items in the following format: CC/agency. The first information item contains the Country Code, defined in ISO 3166, two alpha-numeric characters long. The second item, agency, is a free text identification of the agency, up to a maximum of 32 alpha-numeric characters. 3.1.8. Field 1.008: Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) This field specifies the file originator and has the same format as the DAI (Field 1.007). 3.1.9. Field 1.009: Transaction Control Number (TCN) This is a control number for reference purposes. It should be generated by the computer and have the following format: YYSSSSSSSSA where YY is the year of the transaction, SSSSSSSS is an eight-digit serial number, and A is a check character generated by following the procedure given in Appendix 2. Where a TCN is not available, the field, YYSSSSSSSS, is filled with zeros and the check character generated as above. 3.1.10. Field 1.010: Transaction Control Response (TCR)

Where a request was sent out, to which this is the response, this optional field will contain the transaction control number of the request message. It therefore has the same format as TCN (Field 1.009). 3.1.11. Field 1.011: Native Scanning Resolution (NSR) This field specifies the normal scanning resolution of the system supported by the originator of the transaction. The resolution is specified as two numeric digits followed by the decimal point and then two more digits. For all transactions pursuant to Articles LAW.PRUM.11 [Dactyloscopic data] and LAW.PRUM.12 [Automated searching of dactyloscopic data] the sampling rate shall be 500 pixels/inch or 19,68 pixels/mm. 3.1.12. Field 1.012: Nominal Transmitting Resolution (NTR) This five-byte field specifies the nominal transmitting resolution for the images being transmitted. The resolution is expressed in pixels/mm in the same format as NSR (Field 1.011). 3.1.13. Field 1.013: Domain name (DOM) This mandatory field identifies the domain name for the user-defined Type-2 logical record implementation. It consists of two information items and shall be `INT-I{}{US}}4.22{}{GS}}'. 3.1.14. Field 1.014: Greenwich mean time (GMT) This mandatory field provides a mechanism for expressing the date and time in terms of universal Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) units. If used, the GMT field contains the universal date that will be in addition to the local date contained in Field 1.005 (DAT). Use of the GMT field eliminates local time inconsistencies encountered when a transaction and its response are transmitted between two places separated by several time zones. The GMT provides a universal date and 24-hour clock time independent of time zones. It is represented as `CCYYMMDDHHMMSSZ', a 15-character string that is the concatenation of the date with the GMT and concludes with a `Z'. The `CCYY' characters shall represent the year of the transaction, the `MM' characters shall be the tens and units values of the month, and the `DD' characters shall be the tens and units values of the day of the month, the `HH' characters represent the hour, the `MM' the minute, and the `SS' represents the second. The complete date shall not exceed the current date. 4. Type-2 Logical Record: Descriptive Text

The structure of most of this record is not defined by the original ANSI/NIST standard. The record contains information of specific interest to the agencies sending or receiving the file. To ensure that communicating dactyloscopic systems are compatible, it is required that only the fields listed below are contained within the record. This document specifies which fields are mandatory and which optional, and also defines the structure of the individual fields. 4.1. Fields for Type-2 Logical Record

4.1.1. Field 2.001: Logical Record Length (LEN) 941

This mandatory field contains the length of this Type-2 record, and specifies the total number of bytes including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators. 4.1.2. Field 2.002: Image Designation Character (IDC) The IDC contained in this mandatory field is an ASCII representation of the IDC as defined in the File Content field (CNT) of the Type-1 record (Field 1.003). 4.1.3. Field 2.003: System Information (SYS) This field is mandatory and contains four bytes which indicate which version of the INT-I this particular Type-2 record complies with. The first two bytes specify the major version number, the second two the minor revision number. For example, this implementation is based on INT-I version 4 revision 22 and would be represented as `0422'. 4.1.4. Field 2.007: Case Number (CNO) This is a number assigned by the local dactyloscopic bureau to a collection of latents found at a sceneof-crime. The following format is adopted: CC/number where CC is the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters in length, and the number complies with the appropriate local guidelines and may be up to 32 alpha-numeric characters long. This field allows the system to identify latents associated with a particular crime. 4.1.5. Field 2.008: Sequence Number (SQN) This specifies each sequence of latents within a case. It can be up to four numeric characters long. A sequence is a latent or series of latents which are grouped together for the purposes of filing and/or searching. This definition implies that even single latents will still have to be assigned a sequence number. This field together with MID (Field 2.009) may be included to identify a particular latent within a sequence. 4.1.6. Field 2.009: Latent Identifier (MID) This specifies the individual latent within a sequence. The value is a single letter or two letters, with `A' assigned to the first latent, `B' to the second, and so on up to a limit of `ZZ'. This field is used analogue to the latent sequence number discussed in the description for SQN (Field 2.008). 4.1.7. Field 2.010: Criminal Reference Number (CRN) This is a unique reference number assigned by a national agency to an individual who is charged for the first time with committing an offence. Within one country no individual ever has more than one CRN, or shares it with any other individual. However, the same individual may have Criminal Reference Numbers in several countries, which will be distinguishable by means of the country code. The following format is adopted for CRN field: CC/number 942

where CC is the Country Code, defined in ISO 3166, two alpha-numeric characters in length, and the number complies with the appropriate national guidelines of the issuing agency, and may be up to 32 alpha-numeric characters long. For transactions pursuant to Articles LAW.PRUM.11 [Dactyloscopic data ]and LAW.PRUM.12 [Automated searching of dactyloscopic data] this field will be used for the national criminal reference number of the originating agency which is linked to the images in Type-4 or Type-15 Records. 4.1.8. Field 2.012: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN1) This fields contains the CRN (Field 2.010) transmitted by a CPS or PMS transaction without the leading country code. 4.1.9. Field 2.013: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN2) This fields contains the CNO (Field 2.007) transmitted by an MPS or MMS transaction without the leading country code. 4.1.10. Field 2.014: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN3) This fields contains the SQN (Field 2.008) transmitted by an MPS or MMS transaction. 4.1.11. Field 2.015: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN4) This fields contains the MID (Field 2.009) transmitted by an MPS or MMS transaction. 4.1.12. Field 2.063: Additional Information (INF) In case of an SRE transaction to a PMS request this field gives information about the finger which caused the possible HIT. The format of the field is: NN where NN is the finger position code defined in Table 5, two digits in length. In all other cases the field is optional. It consists of up to 32 alpha-numeric characters and may give additional information about the request. 4.1.13. Field 2.064: Respondents List (RLS) This field contains at least two subfields. The first subfield describes the type of search that has been carried out, using the three-letter mnemonics which specify the transaction type in TOT (Field 1.004). The second subfield contains a single character. An `I' shall be used to indicate that a HIT has been found and an `N' shall be used to indicate that no matching cases have been found (No-HIT). The third subfield contains the sequence identifier for the candidate result and the total number of candidates separated by a slash. Multiple messages will be returned if multiple candidates exist. In case of a possible HIT the fourth subfield shall contain the score up to six digits long. If the HIT has been verified the value of this subfield is defined as `999999'. Example: `CPS{}{RS}}I{}{RS}}001/001{}{RS}}999999{}{GS}}' If the remote AFIS does not assign scores, then a score of zero should be used at the appropriate point. 943

Field 2.320: Expected Number of Candidates (ENC) This field contains the maximum number of candidates for verification expected by the requesting agency. The value of ENC shall not exceed the values defined in Table 11. 5. Type-4 Logical Record: High Resolution GreyScale Image

It should be noted that Type-4 records are binary rather than ASCII in nature. Therefore each field is assigned a specific position within the record, which implies that all fields are mandatory. The standard allows both image size and resolution to be specified within the record. It requires Type4 Logical Records to contain dactyloscopic image data that are being transmitted at a nominal pixel density of 500 to 520 pixels per inch. The preferred rate for new designs is at a pixel density of 500 pixels per inch or 19,68 pixels per mm. 500 pixels per inch is the density specified by the INT-I, except 945

that similar systems may communicate with each other at a non-preferred rate, within the limits of 500 to 520 pixels per inch. 5.1. Fields for Type-4 Logical Record

5.1.1. Field 4.001: Logical Record Length (LEN) This four-byte field contains the length of this Type-4 record, and specifies the total number of bytes including every byte of every field contained in the record. 5.1.2. Field 4.002: Image Designation Character (IDC) This is the one-byte binary representation of the IDC number given in the header file. 5.1.3. Field 4.003: Impression Type (IMP) The impression type is a single-byte field occupying the sixth byte of the record. Table 4: Finger Impression Type Code 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Description Live-scan of plain fingerprint Live-scan of rolled fingerprint Non-live scan impression of plain fingerprint captured from paper Non-live scan impression of rolled fingerprint captured from paper Latent impression captured directly Latent tracing Latent photo Latent lift Swipe Unknown

5.1.4. Field 4.004: Finger Position (FGP) This fixed-length field of six bytes occupies the seventh through twelfth byte positions of a Type-4 record. It contains possible finger positions beginning in the left most byte (byte seven of the record). The known or most probable finger position is taken from Table 5. Up to five additional fingers may 946

be referenced by entering the alternate finger positions in the remaining five bytes using the same format. If fewer than five finger position references are to be used the unused bytes are filled with binary 255. To reference all finger positions code 0, for unknown, is used.

For scene of crime latents only the codes 0 to 10 should be used. 5.1.5. Field 4.005: Image Scanning Resolution (ISR) This one-byte field occupies the 13th byte of a Type-4 record. If it contains '0' then the image has been sampled at the preferred scanning rate of 19,68 pixels/mm (500 pixels per inch). If it contains '1' then the image has been sampled at an alternative scanning rate as specified in the Type-1 record. 947

5.1.6. Field 4.006: Horizontal Line Length (HLL) This field is positioned at bytes 14 and 15 within the Type-4 record. It specifies the number of pixels contained in each scan line. The first byte will be the most significant. 5.1.7. Field 4.007: Vertical Line Length (VLL) This field records in bytes 16 and 17 the number of scan lines present in the image. The first byte is the most significant. 5.1.8. Field 4.008: Greyscale Compression Algorithm (GCA) This one-byte field specifies the greyscale compression algorithm used to encode the image data. For this implementation, a binary code 1 indicates that WSQ compression (Appendix 7) has been used. 5.1.9. Field 4.009: The Image This field contains a byte stream representing the image. Its structure will obviously depend on the compression algorithm used. 6. Type-9 Logical Record: Minutiæ Record

Type-9 records shall contain ASCII text describing minutiæ and related information encoded from a latent. For latent search transaction, there is no limit for these Type-9 records in a file, each of which shall be for a different view or latent. 6.1. Minutiæ extraction

6.1.1. Minutia type identification This standard defines three identifier numbers that are used to describe the minutia type. These are listed in Table 6. A ridge ending shall be designated Type 1. A bifurcation shall be designated Type 2. If a minutia cannot be clearly categorised as one of the above two types, it shall be designated as `other', Type 0. Table 6: Minutia types Type 0 1 2 Description Other Ridge ending Bifurcation

For templates to be compliant with Section 5 of the ANSI INCITS 378-2004 standard, the following method, which enhances the current INCITS 378-2004 standard, shall be used for determining placement (location and angular direction) of individual minutiæ. The position or location of a minutia representing a ridge ending shall be the point of forking of the medial skeleton of the valley area immediately in front of the ridge ending. If the three legs of the valley area were thinned down to a single-pixel-wide skeleton, the point of the intersection is the location of the minutia. Similarly, the location of the minutia for a bifurcation shall be the point of forking of the medial skeleton of the ridge. If the three legs of the ridge were each thinned down to a single-pixel-wide skeleton, the point where the three legs intersect is the location of the minutia. After all ridge endings have been converted to bifurcations, all of the minutiæ of the dactyloscopic image are represented as bifurcations. The X and Y pixel coordinates of the intersection of the three legs of each minutia can be directly formatted. Determination of the minutia direction can be extracted from each skeleton bifurcation. The three legs of every skeleton bifurcation shall be examined and the endpoint of each leg determined. Figure 6.1.2 illustrates the three methods used for determining the end of a leg that is based on a scanning resolution of 500 ppi. The ending is established according to the event that occurs first. The pixel count is based on a scan resolution of 500 ppi. Different scan resolutions would imply different pixel counts. ­ ­ a distance of 0,064" (the 32nd pixel); the end of skeleton leg that occurs between a distance of 0,02" and 0,064" (the 10th through the 32nd pixels); shorter legs are not used; a second bifurcation is encountered within a distance of 0,064" (before the 32nd pixel). Figure 4

­

The angle of the minutiæ is determined by constructing three virtual rays originating at the bifurcation point and extending to the end of each leg. The smallest of the three angles formed by the rays is bisected to indicate the minutiæ direction. 6.1.3. Coordinate system The coordinate system used to express the minutiæ of a fingerprint shall be a Cartesian coordinate system. Minutiæ locations shall be represented by their x and y coordinates. The origin of the coordinate system shall be the upper left corner of the original image with x increasing to the right 949

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

and y increasing downward. Both x and y coordinates of a minutiæ shall be represented in pixel units from the origin. It should be noted that the location of the origin and units of measure is not in agreement with the convention used in the definitions of the Type 9 in the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000. 6.1.4. Minutiæ direction Angles are expressed in standard mathematical format, with zero degrees to the right and angles increasing in the counter clockwise direction. Recorded angles are in the direction pointing back along the ridge for a ridge ending and toward the centre of the valley for a bifurcation. This convention is 180 degrees opposite of the angle convention described in the definitions of the Type 9 in the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000. 6.2. Fields for Type-9 Logical record INCITS-378 Format

All fields of the Type-9 records shall be recorded as ASCII text. No binary fields are permissible in this tagged-field record. 6.2.1. Field 9.001: Logical record length (LEN) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the length of the logical record specifying the total number of bytes, including every character of every field contained in the record. 6.2.2. Field 9.002: Image designation character (IDC) This mandatory two-byte field shall be used for the identification and location of the minutiæ data. The IDC contained in this field shall match the IDC found in the file content field of the Type-1 record. 6.2.3. Field 9.003: Impression type (IMP) This mandatory one-byte field shall describe the manner by which the dactyloscopic image information was obtained. The ASCII value of the proper code as selected from Table 4 shall be entered in this field to signify the impression type. 6.2.4. Field 9.004: Minutiæ format (FMT) This field shall contain a `U' to indicate that the minutiæ are formatted in M1-378 terms. Even though information may be encoded in accordance with the M1-378 standard, all data fields of the Type-9 record shall remain as ASCII text fields. 6.2.5. Field 9.126: CBEFF information This field shall contain three information items. The first information item shall contain the value `27' (0x1B). This is the identification of the CBEFF Format Owner assigned by the International Biometric Industry Association (IBIA) to INCITS Technical Committee M1. The <US> character shall delimit this item from the CBEFF Format Type that is assigned a value of `513' (0x0201) to indicate that this record contains only location and angular direction data without any Extended Data Block information. The <US> character shall delimit this item from the CBEFF Product Identifier (PID) that identifies the `owner' of the encoding equipment. The vendor establishes this value. It can be obtained from the IBIA website (www.ibia.org) if it is posted. 950

6.2.6. Field 9.127: Capture equipment identification This field shall contain two information items separated by the <US> character. The first shall contain `APPF' if the equipment used originally to acquire the image was certified to comply with Appendix F (IAFIS Image Quality Specification, 29 January 1999) of CJIS-RS-0010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification. If the equipment did not comply, it will contain the value of `NONE'. The second information item shall contain the Capture Equipment ID which is a vendor-assigned product number of the capture equipment. A value of `0' indicates that the capture equipment ID is unreported. 6.2.7. Field 9.128: Horizontal line length (HLL) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image. The maximum horizontal size is limited to 65534 pixels. 6.2.8. Field 9.129: Vertical line length (VLL) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of horizontal lines contained in the transmitted image. The maximum vertical size is limited to 65534 pixels. 6.2.9. Field 9.130: Scale units (SLC) This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency (pixel density). A `1' in this field indicates pixels per inch, or a `2' indicates pixels per centimetre. A `0' in this field indicates no scale is given. In this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect ratio. 6.2.10. Field 9.131: Horizontal pixel scale (HPS) This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction providing the SLC contains a `1' or a `2'. Otherwise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel aspect ratio. 6.2.11. Field 9.132: Vertical pixel scale (VPS) This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the vertical direction providing the SLC contains a `1' or a `2'. Otherwise, it indicates the vertical component of the pixel aspect ratio. 6.2.12. Field 9.133: Finger view This mandatory field contains the view number of the finger associated with this record's data. The view number begins with `0' and increments by one to `15'. 6.2.13. Field 9.134: Finger position (FGP) This field shall contain the code designating the finger position that produced the information in this Type-9 record. A code between 1 and 10 taken from Table 5 or the appropriate palm code from Table 10 shall be used to indicate the finger or palm position. 6.2.14. Field 9.135: Finger quality 951

The field shall contain the quality of the overall finger minutiæ data and shall be between 0 and 100. This number is an overall expression of the quality of the finger record, and represents quality of the original image, of the minutia extraction and any additional operations that may affect the minutiæ record. 6.2.15. Field 9.136: number of minutiæ The mandatory field shall contain a count of the number of minutiæ recorded in this logical record. 6.2.16. Field 9.137: Finger minutiæ data This mandatory field has six information items separated by the <US> character. It consists of several subfields, each containing the details of single minutiae. The total number of minutiae subfields must agree with the count found in field 136. The first information item is the minutiae index number, which shall be initialised to `1' and incremented by `1' for each additional minutia in the fingerprint. The second and third information items are the `x' coordinate and `y' coordinates of the minutiae in pixel units. The fourth information item is the minutiae angle recorded in units of two degrees. This value shall be nonnegative between 0 and 179. The fifth information item is the minutiae type. A value of `0' is used to represent minutiae of type `OTHER', a value of `1' for a ridge ending and a value of `2' for a ridge bifurcation. The sixth information item represents the quality of each minutiae. This value shall range from 1 as a minimum to 100 as a maximum. A value of `0' indicates that no quality value is available. Each subfield shall be separated from the next with the use of the <RS> separator character. 6.2.17. Field 9.138: Ridge count information This field consists of a series of subfields each containing three information items. The first information item of the first subfield shall indicate the ridge count extraction method. A `0' indicates that no assumption shall be made about the method used to extract ridge counts, nor their order in the record. A `1' indicates that for each centre minutiæ, ridge count data was extracted to the nearest neighbouring minutiæ in four quadrants, and ridge counts for each centre minutia are listed together. A `2' indicates that for each centre minutiæ, ridge count data was extracted to the nearest neighbouring minutiæ in eight octants, and ridge counts for each centre minutia are listed together. The remaining two information items of the first subfield shall both contain `0'. Information items shall be separated by the <US> separator character. Subsequent subfields will contain the centre minutiæ index number as the first information item, the neighbouring minutiæ index number as the second information item, and the number of ridges crossed as the third information item. Subfields shall be separated by the <RS> separator character. 6.2.18. Field 9.139: Core information This field will consist of one subfield for each core present in the original image. Each subfield consists of three information items. The first two items contain the `x' and `y' coordinate positions in pixel units. The third information item contains the angle of the core recorded in units of 2 degrees. The value shall be a nonnegative value between 0 and 179. Multiple cores will be separated by the <RS> separator character. 6.2.19. Field 9.140: Delta information This field will consist of one subfield for each delta present in the original image.

Key for character type: N = Numeric; A = Alphabetic; AN = Alphanumeric; B = Binary 7.1. Fields for the Type-13 logical record

The following paragraphs describe the data contained in each of the fields for the Type-13 logical record. Within a Type-13 logical record, entries shall be provided in numbered fields. It is required that the first two fields of the record are ordered, and the field containing the image data shall be the last physical field in the record. For each field of the Type-13 record, Table 7 lists the `condition code' as being mandatory `M' or optional `O', the field number, the field name, character type, field size, and occurrence limits. Based on a three digit field number, the maximum byte count size for the field is given in the last column. As more digits are used for the field number, the maximum byte count will also increase. The two entries in the `field size per occurrence' include all character separators used in the field. The `maximum byte count' includes the field number, the information, and all the character separators including the `GS' character. 7.1.1. Field 13.001: Logical record length (LEN) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in the Type-13 logical record. Field 13.001 shall specify the length of the record including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators. 7.1.2. Field 13.002: Image designation character (IDC) This mandatory ASCII field shall be used to identify the latent image data contained in the record. This IDC shall match the IDC found in the file content (CNT) field of the Type-1 record. 955

7.1.3. Field 13.003: Impression type (IMP) This mandatory one- or two-byte ASCII field shall indicate the manner by which the latent image information was obtained. The appropriate latent code choice selected from Table 4 (finger) or Table 9 (palm) shall be entered in this field. 7.1.4. Field 13.004: Source agency/ORI (SRC) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the identification of the administration or organisation that originally captured the facial image contained in the record. Normally, the Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) of the agency that captured the image will be contained in this field. It consists of two information items in the following format: CC/agency. The first information item contains the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters long. The second item, agency, is a free text identification of the agency, up to a maximum of 32 alpha-numeric characters. 7.1.5. Field 13.005: Latent capture date (LCD) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the date that the latent image contained in the record was captured. The date shall appear as eight digits in the format CCYYMMDD. The CCYY characters shall represent the year the image was captured; the MM characters shall be the tens and unit values of the month; and the DD characters shall be the tens and unit values of the day in the month. For example, 20000229 represents 29 February 2000. The complete date shall be a legitimate date. 7.1.6. Field 13.006: Horizontal line length (HLL) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image. 7.1.7. Field 13.007: Vertical line length (VLL) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of horizontal lines contained in the transmitted image. 7.1.8. Field 13.008: Scale units (SLC) This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency (pixel density). A `1' in this field indicates pixels per inch, or a `2' indicates pixels per centimetre. A `0' in this field indicates no scale is given. In this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect ratio. 7.1.9. Field 13.009: Horizontal pixel scale (HPS) This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction providing the SLC contains a `1' or a `2'. Otherwise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel aspect ratio. 7.1.10. Field 13.010: Vertical pixel scale (VPS)

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the vertical direction providing the SLC contains a `1' or a `2'. Otherwise, it indicates the vertical component of the pixel aspect ratio. 7.1.11. Field 13.011: Compression algorithm (CGA) This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the algorithm used to compress greyscale images. See Appendix 7 for the compression codes. 7.1.12. Field 13.012: Bits per pixel (BPX) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of bits used to represent a pixel. This field shall contain an entry of `8' for normal greyscale values of `0' to `255'. Any entry in this field greater than `8' shall represent a greyscale pixel with increased precision. 7.1.13. Field 13.013: Finger/palm position (FGP) This mandatory tagged-field shall contain one or more of the possible finger or palm positions that may match the latent image. The decimal code number corresponding to the known or most probable finger position shall be taken from Table 5 or the most probable palm position from Table 10 and entered as a one- or two-character ASCII subfield. Additional finger and/or palm positions may be referenced by entering the alternate position codes as subfields separated by the `RS' separator character. The code `0', for `Unknown Finger', shall be used to reference every finger position from one through ten. The code `20', for `Unknown Palm', shall be used to reference every listed palmprint position. 7.1.14. Field 13.014-019: Reserved for future definition (RSV) These fields are reserved for inclusion in future revisions of this standard. None of these fields are to be used at this revision level. If any of these fields are present, they are to be ignored. 7.1.15. Field 13.020: Comment (COM) This optional field may be used to insert comments or other ASCII text information with the latent image data. 7.1.16. Field 13.021-199: Reserved for future definition (RSV) These fields are reserved for inclusion in future revisions of this standard. None of these fields are to be used at this revision level. If any of these fields are present, they are to be ignored. 7.1.17. Fields 13.200-998: User-defined fields (UDF) These fields are user-definable fields and will be used for future requirements. Their size and content shall be defined by the user and be in accordance with the receiving agency. If present they shall contain ASCII textual information. 7.1.18. Field 13.999: Image data (DAT)

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

This field shall contain all data from a captured latent image. It shall always be assigned field number 999 and shall be the last physical field in the record. For example, `13.999:' is followed by image data in a binary representation. Each pixel of uncompressed greyscale data shall normally be quantised to eight bits (256 grey levels) contained in a single byte. If the entry in BPX Field 13.012 is greater or less than `8', the number of bytes required to contain a pixel will be different. If compression is used, the pixel data shall be compressed in accordance with the compression technique specified in the GCA field. 7.2. End of Type-13 variable-resolution latent image record

For the sake of consistency, immediately following the last byte of data from Field 13.99 9 an `FS' separator shall be used to separate it from the next logical record. This separator shall be included in the length field of the Type-13 record. 8. Type-15 variable-resolution palmprint image record

The Type-15 tagged-field logical record shall contain and be used to exchange palmprint image data together with fixed and user-defined textual information fields pertinent to the digitised image. Information regarding the scanning resolution used, the image size and other parameters or comments required to process the image are recorded as tagged-fields within the record. Palmprint images transmitted to other agencies will be processed by the recipient agencies to extract the desired feature information required for matching purposes. The image data shall be acquired directly from a subject using a live-scan device, or from a palmprint card or other media that contains the subject's palmprints. Any method used to acquire the palmprint images shall be capable of capturing a set of images for each hand. This set shall include the writer's palm as a single scanned image, and the entire area of the full palm extending from the wrist bracelet to the tips of the fingers as one or two scanned images. If two images are used to represent the full palm, the lower image shall extend from the wrist bracelet to the top of the interdigital area (third finger joint) and shall include the thenar, and hypothenar areas of the palm. The upper image shall extend from the bottom of the interdigital area to the upper tips of the fingers. This provides an adequate amount of overlap between the two images that are both located over the interdigital area of the palm. By matching the ridge structure and details contained in this common area, an examiner can confidently state that both images came from the same palm. As a palmprint transaction may be used for different purposes, it may contain one or more unique image areas recorded from the palm or hand. A complete palmprint record set for one individual will normally include the writer's palm and the full palm image(s) from each hand. Since a tagged-field logical image record may contain only one binary field, a single Type-15 record will be required for each writer's palm and one or two Type-15 records for each full palm. Therefore, four to six Type-15 records will be required to represent the subject's palmprints in a normal palmprint transaction. 8.1. Fields for the Type-15 logical record

The following paragraphs describe the data contained in each of the fields for the Type-15 logical record.

Within a Type-15 logical record, entries shall be provided in numbered fields. It is required that the first two fields of the record are ordered, and the field containing the image data shall be the last physical field in the record. For each field of the Type-15 record, Table 8 lists the `condition code' as being mandatory `M' or optional `O', the field number, the field name, character type, field size, and occurrence limits. Based on a three digit field number, the maximum byte count size for the field is given in the last column. As more digits are used for the field number, the maximum byte count will also increase. The two entries in the `field size per occurrence' include all character separators used in the field. The `maximum byte count' includes the field number, the information, and all the character separators including the `GS' character. 8.1.1. Field 15.001: Logical record length (LEN) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in the Type-15 logical record. Field 15.001 shall specify the length of the record including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators. 8.1.2. Field 15.002: Image designation character (IDC) This mandatory ASCII field shall be used to identify the palmprint image contained in the record. This IDC shall match the IDC found in the file content (CNT) field of the Type-1 record. 8.1.3. Field 15.003: Impression type (IMP) This mandatory one-byte ASCII field shall indicate the manner by which the palmprint image information was obtained. The appropriate code selected from Table 9 shall be entered in this field. 8.1.4. Field 15.004: Source agency/ORI (SRC) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the identification of the administration or organisation that originally captured the facial image contained in the record. Normally, the Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) of the agency that captured the image will be contained in this field. It consists of two information items in the following format: CC/agency. The first information item contains the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters long. The second item, agency, is a free text identification of the agency, up to a maximum of 32 alpha-numeric characters. 8.1.5. Field 15.005: Palmprint capture date (PCD) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the date that the palmprint image was captured. The date shall appear as eight digits in the format CCYYMMDD. The CCYY characters shall represent the year the image was captured; the MM characters shall be the tens and unit values of the month; and the DD characters shall be the tens and units values of the day in the month. For example, the entry 20000229 represents 29 February 2000. The complete date shall be a legitimate date. 8.1.6. Field 15.006: Horizontal line length (HLL) This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image. 959

The definitions of mandatory and optional data elements set out in Article 14(4) of Chapter 0 are as follows: Mandatory (M): The data element has to be communicated when the information is available in a State's national register. Therefore there is an obligation to exchange the information when available. Optional (O): The data element may be communicated when the information is available in a State's national register. Therefore there is no obligation to exchange the information even when the information is available. An indication (Y) is given for each element in the data set where the element is specifically identified as important in relation with Article LAW.PRUM.15 [Automated searching of vehicle registration data]. 1.2. Vehicle/owner/holder search

1.2.1. Triggers for the search There are two different ways to search for the information as defined in the next paragraph: ­ ­ by Chassis Number (VIN), Reference Date and Time (optional), by License Plate Number, Chassis Number (VIN) (optional), Reference Date and Time (optional).

By means of these search criteria, information related to one and sometimes more vehicles will be returned. If information for only one vehicle has to be returned, all the items are returned in one response. If more than one vehicle is found, the requested State itself can determine which items will be returned; all items or only the items to refine the search (e.g. because of privacy reasons or because of performance reasons). The items necessary to refine the search are pictured in paragraph 1.2.2.1. In paragraph 1.2.2.2 the complete information set is described. When the search is done by Chassis Number, Reference Date and Time, the search can be done in one or all of the participating States. When the search is done by License Number, Reference Data and Time, the search has to be done in one specific State. 975

Normally the actual Date and Time is used to make a search, but it is possible to conduct a search with a Reference Date and Time in the past. When a search is made with a Reference Date and Time in the past and historical information is not available in the register of the specific State because no such information is registered at all, the actual information can be returned with an indication that the information is actual information. 1.2.2.

Data Security Overview

The Eucaris software application handles secure communication to the other States and communicates to the back-end legacy systems of States using XML. States exchange messages by directly sending them to the recipient. The data centre of a State is connected to the TESTA network. The XML-messages sent over the network are encrypted. The technique to encrypt these messages is SSL. The messages sent to the back-end are plain text XML-messages since the connection between the application and the back-end shall be in a protected environment. A client application is provided which can be used within a State to query their own register or other States' registers. The clients will be identified by means of user-id/password or a client certificate. The connection to a user may be encrypted, but this is the responsibility of each individual State. 2.2. Security Features related to message exchange

The security design is based on a combination of HTTPS and XML signature. This alternative uses XMLsignature to sign all messages sent so the server and can authenticate the sender of the message by checking the signature. 1-sided SSL (only a server certificate) is used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the message in transit and provides protection against deletion/replay and insertion attacks. Instead of bespoke software development to implement 2-sided SSL, XML-signature is implemented. Using XML-signature is closer to the web services roadmap than 2-sided SSL and therefore more strategic. The XML-signature can be implemented in several ways but the chosen approach is to use XML Signature as part of the Web Services Security (WSS). WSS specifies how to use XML-signature. Since WSS builds upon the SOAP standard, it is logical to adhere to the SOAP standard as much as possible. 2.3. Security features not related to message exchange

2.3.1. Authentication of users 980
24.12.2020

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

The users of the Eucaris web application authenticate themselves using a username and password. Since standard Windows authentication is used, States can enhance the level of authentication of users if needed by using client certificates. 2.3.2. User roles The Eucaris software application supports different user roles. Each cluster of services has its own authorisation. E.g. (exclusive) users of the `"Treaty of Eucaris" -- functionality' may not use the `"Prüm" -- functionality'. Administrator services are separated from the regular end-user roles. 2.3.3. Logging and tracing of message exchange Logging of all message types is facilitated by the Eucaris software application. An administrator function allows the national administrator to determine which messages are logged: requests from end-users, incoming requests from other States, provided information from the national registers, etc. The application can be configured to use an internal database for this logging, or an external (Oracle) database. The decision on what messages have to be logged clearly depends on logging facilities elsewhere in the legacy systems and connected client applications. The header of each message contains information on the requesting State, the requesting organisation within that State and the user involved. Also the reason of the request is indicated. By means of the combined logging in the requesting and responding State complete tracing of any message exchange is possible (e.g. on request of a citizen involved). Logging is configured through the Eucaris web client (menu Administration, Logging configuration). The logging functionality is performed by the Core System. When logging is enabled, the complete message (header and body) is stored in one logging record. Per defined service, and per message type that passes along the Core System, the logging level can be set. Logging Levels The following logging levels are possible: Private -- Message is logged: The logging is NOT available to the extract logging service but is available on a national level only, for audits and problem solving. None -- Message is not logged at all. Message Types Information exchange between States consists of several messages, of which a schematic representation is given in Figure 5 below. The possible message types (in Figure 5 shown for the Eucaris Core System of State X) are the following: 1. 2. Request to Core System_Request message by Client; Request to Other State_Request message by Core System of this State; 981

The following information exchanges are shown in Figure 5: * Information request from State X to State Y -- blue arrows. This request and response consists of message types 1, 2, 7 and 6, respectively; * Information request from State Z to State X -- red arrows. This request and response consists of message types 3, 4, 9 and 8, respectively; Information request from the legacy register to its core system (this route also includes a request from a custom client behind the legacy register) -- green arrows. This kind of request consists of message types 5 and 10. Figure 5: Message types for logging

2.3.4. Hardware Security Module A Hardware Security Module is not used. A Hardware Security Module (HSM) provides good protection for the key used to sign messages and to identify servers. This adds to the overall level of security but an HSM is expensive to buy/maintain and there are no requirements to decide for a FIPS 140-2 level 2 or level 3 HSM. Since a closed network is used that mitigates threats effectively, it is decided not to use an HSM initially. If an HSM is necessary e.g. to obtain accreditation, it can be added to the architecture. 3. 3.1. Technical conditions of the data exchange General description of the Eucaris application

3.1.1. Overview The Eucaris application connects all participating States in a mesh network where each State communicates directly to another State. There is no central component needed for the communication to be established. The Eucaris application handles secure communication to the other States and communicates to the back-end legacy systems of States using XML. The following picture visualises this architecture.

States exchange messages by directly sending them to the recipient. The data centre of a State is connected to the network used for the message exchange (TESTA). To access the TESTA network, States connect to TESTA via their national gate. A firewall shall be used to connect to the network and a router connects the Eucaris application to the firewall. Depending on the alternative chosen to protect the messages, a certificate is used either by the router or by the Eucaris application. A client application is provided which can be used within a State to query its own register or other States' registers. The client application connects to Eucaris. The clients will be identified by means of user-id/password or a client certificate. The connection to a user in an external organisation (e.g. police) may be encrypted but this is the responsibility of each individual State. 3.1.2. Scope of the system 983

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

The scope of the Eucaris system is limited to the processes involved in the exchange of information between the Registration Authorities in the States and a basic presentation of this information. Procedures and automated processes in which the information is to be used, are outside the scope of the system. States can choose either to use the Eucaris client functionality or to set up their own customised client application. The table below describes which aspects of the Eucaris system are mandatory to use and/or prescribed and which are optional to use and/or free to determine by the States. Eucaris aspects Network concept Physical network Core application M/O
155

Remark

M

The concept is an `any-to-any' communication.

M

TESTA

M

The core application of Eucaris has to be used to connect to the other States. The following functionality is offered by the core: * * * * * Encrypting and signing of the messages; Checking of the identity of the sender; Authorisation of States and local users; Routing of messages; Queuing of asynchronous messages if the recipient service is temporally unavailable; Multiple country inquiry functionality; Logging of the exchange of messages; Storage of incoming messages

* * * Client application O

In addition to the core application the Eucaris II client application can be used by a State. When applicable, the core and client application are modified under auspices of the Eucaris organisation.

Security concept Message specifications

M

The concept is based on XML-signing by means of client certificates and SSLencryption by means of service certificates. Every State has to comply with the message specifications as set by the Eucaris organisation and this Chapter. The specifications can only be changed by the Eucaris organisation in consultation with the States. The acceptance of new States or a new functionality is under auspices of the Eucaris organisation. Monitoring and help desk functions are managed centrally by an appointed State.

Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

3.2.1. Generic functionality In this section the main generic functions have been described in general terms. No 1. Description The system allows the Registration Authorities of the States to exchange request and response messages in an interactive way. The system contains a client application, enabling end-users to send their requests and presenting the response information for manual processing. The system facilitates `broadcasting', allowing a State to send a request to all other States. The incoming responses are consolidated by the core application in one response message to the client application (this functionality is called a "Multiple Country Inquiry"). The system is able to deal with different types of messages. User roles, authorisation, routing, signing and logging are all defined per specific service. The system allows the States to exchange batches of messages or messages containing a large number of requests or replies. These messages are dealt with in an asynchronous way. The system queues asynchronous messages if the recipient State is temporarily unavailable and guarantees the deliverance as soon as the recipient is up again. The system stores incoming asynchronous messages until they can be processed. The system only gives access to Eucaris applications of other States, not to individual organisations within those other States, i.e. each Registration Authority acts as the single gateway between its national end-users and the corresponding Authorities in the other States.

9.

It is possible to define users of different States on one Eucaris server and to authorise them following the rights of that State. Information on the requesting State, organisation and end user are included in the messages. The system facilitates logging of the exchange of messages between the different States and between the core application and the national registration systems. The system allows a specific secretary, which is an organisation or State explicitly appointed for this task, to gather logged information on messages sent/received by all the participating States, in order to produce statistical reports. Each State indicates itself what logged information is made available for the secretary and what information is `private'. The system allows the National Administrators of each State to extract statistics of use. The system enables addition of new States through simple administrative tasks.

10. 11.

12.

13.

14. 15.

3.2.2. Usability No 16. Description The system provides an interface for automated processing of messages by back-end systems/legacy and enables the integration of the user interface in those systems (customised user-interface). The system is easy to learn, self-explanatory and contains help-text. The system is documented to assist States in integration, operational activities and future maintenance (e.g. reference guides, functional/technical documentation, operational guide, ...). The user interface is multi-lingual and offers facilities for the end-user to select a preferred language. The user interface contains facilities for a Local Administrator to translate both screen-items and coded information to the national language.

21.

The system is designed as a robust and dependable operational system which is tolerant to operator errors and which will recover cleanly from power cuts or other disasters. It shall be possible to restart the system with no or minimal loss of data. The system shall give stable and reproducible results. The system has been designed to function reliably. It is possible to implement the system in a configuration that guarantees an availability of 98 % (by redundancy, the use of back-up servers, etc.) in each bilateral communication. It is possible to use part of the system, even during failure of some components (if State C is down, States A and B are still able to communicate). The number of single points of failure in the information chain should be minimised. The recovery time after a severe failure should be less than one day. It should be possible to minimise down-time by using remote support, e.g. by a central service desk.

22. 23.

24.

25.

3.2.4. Performance No 26. Description The system can be used 24x7. This time-window (24x7) is then also required from the States' legacy systems. The system responds rapidly to user requests irrespective of any background tasks. This is also required from the Parties legacy systems to ensure acceptable response time. An overall response time of 10 seconds maximum for a single request is acceptable. The system has been designed as a multi-user system and in such a way that background tasks can continue while the user performs foreground tasks. The system has been designed to be scaleable in order to support the potential increase of number of messages when new functionality is added or new organisations or States are added.

27.

28.

29.

3.2.5. Security No 30. Description The system is suited (e.g. in its security measures) for the exchange of messages containing privacy-sensitive personal data (e.g. car owner/holders), classified as EU restricted.

31. 32.

The system is maintained in such a way that unauthorised access to the data is prevented. The system contains a service for the management of the rights and permissions of national end-users. States are able to check the identity of the sender (at State level), by means of XML-signing. States shall explicitly authorise other States to request specific information. The system provides at application level a full security and encryption policy compatible with the level of security required in such situations. Exclusiveness and integrity of the information is guaranteed by the use of XML-signing and encryption by means of SSL-tunnelling. All exchange of messages can be traced by means of logging. Protection is provided against deletion attacks (a third party deletes a message) and replay or insertion attacks (a third party replays or inserts a message). The system makes use of certificates of a Trusted Third Party (TTP). The system is able to handle different certificates per State, depending on the type of message or service. The security measures at application level are sufficient to allow the use of non-accredited networks. The system is able to use novice security techniques such as an XML-firewall.

41.

3.2.6. Adaptability No 42. Description The system is extensible with new messages and new functionality. The costs of adaptations are minimal. Due to the centralised development of application components. States are able to define new message types for bilateral use. Not all States are required to support all message types.

43.

The system provides monitoring facilities for a central service-desk and/or operators concerning the network and servers in the different States. The system provides facilities for remote support by a central service-desk. The system provides facilities for problem analysis. The system can be expanded to new States. The application can easily be installed by staff with a minimum of IT-qualifications and experience. The installation procedure shall be as much as possible automated. The system provides a permanent testing and acceptance environment. The annual costs of maintenance and support has been minimised by adherence to market standards and by creating the application in such a way that as little support as possible from a central service-desk is required.

45. 46. 47. 48.

49. 50.

3.2.8. Design requirements No 51. 52. 53. Description The system is designed and documented for an operational lifetime of many years. The system has been designed in such a way that it is independent of the network provider. The system is compliant with the existing HW/SW in the States by interacting with those registration systems using open standard web service technology (XML, XSD, SOAP, WSDL, HTTP(s), Web services, WSS, X.509, etc.).

3.2.9. Applicable standards No 54. Description The system is compliant with data protection issues as stated in Regulation EC 45/2001 (Articles 21, 22 and 23) and Directive 95/46/EC. The system complies with the IDA Standards. The system supports UTF8.

ANNEX LAW-6: EXCHANGE OF CRIMINAL RECORD INFORMATION ­ TECHNICAL AND PROCEDURAL SPECIFICATIONS CHAPTER 1­ GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1: Objective The objective of this Annex is to lay down the necessary procedural and technical provisions for the implementation of Title IX [Exchange of criminal record information] of Part Three. Article 2: Communications network 1. The electronic exchange of information extracted from the criminal record between, on the one side, a Member State and, on the other side, the United Kingdom shall take place using a common communication infrastructure that provides for encrypted communications. 2. The common communication infrastructure shall be the Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) communications network. Any further developments thereof or any alternative secure network shall ensure that the common communication infrastructure in place continues to fulfil the security requirements adequate for the exchange of criminal record information. Article 3: Interconnection software 1. The States shall use a standardised interconnection software enabling the connection of their central authorities to the common communication infrastructure in order to exchange the information extracted from the criminal record with the other States electronically in accordance with the provisions of Title IX [Exchange of criminal record information] of Part Three and this Annex. 2. For the Member States, the interconnection software shall be the ECRIS reference implementation software or their national ECRIS implementation software, if necessary adapted for the purposes of information exchange with the United Kingdom as set out in this Agreement. 3. The United Kingdom shall be responsible for the development and operation of its own interconnection software.

As soon as the requested authority has received the information referred to in paragraph 3, either from the applicant authority or from the interested party, it shall suspend the enforcement procedure, as far as the contested part of the claim is concerned, pending the decision of the body competent in the matter, unless the applicant authority requests otherwise in accordance with the third subparagraph of this paragraph. At the request of the applicant authority, or where otherwise deemed to be necessary by the requested authority, and without prejudice to Article 31 [Request for precautionary measures], the requested authority may take precautionary measures to guarantee recovery in so far as the applicable laws or regulations allow. The applicant authority may, in accordance with the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in its State, ask the requested authority to recover a contested claim or the contested part of a claim, in so far as the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in the State of the requested authority allow. Any such request shall be reasoned. If the result of contestation is subsequently favourable to the debtor, the applicant authority shall be liable for reimbursing any sums 1075

recovered, together with any compensation due, in accordance with the laws in force in the State of the requested authority. If a mutual agreement procedure has been initiated between the State of the applicant authority and the State of requested authority, and the outcome of the procedure may affect the claim in respect of which assistance has been requested, the recovery measures shall be suspended or stopped until that procedure has been terminated, unless it concerns a case of immediate urgency because of fraud or insolvency. If the recovery measures are suspended or stopped, the second subparagraph shall apply. Article 30: Amendment or withdrawal of the request for recovery assistance 1. The applicant authority shall inform the requested authority immediately of any subsequent amendment to its request for recovery or of the withdrawal of its request, indicating the reasons for amendment or withdrawal. 2. If the amendment of the request is caused by a decision of the competent body referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 29 [Disputed claims and enforcement measures], the applicant authority shall communicate this decision together with a revised uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority. The requested authority shall then proceed with further recovery measures on the basis of the revised instrument. Recovery or precautionary measures already taken on the basis of the original uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority may be continued on the basis of the revised instrument, unless the amendment of the request is due to invalidity of the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority or the original uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority. Articles 27 [Instruments permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority and other accompanying documents] and 29 [Disputed claims and enforcement measures] shall apply in relation to the revised instrument. Article 31: Request for precautionary measures 1. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall take precautionary measures, if allowed by its national law and in accordance with its administrative practices, to ensure recovery where a claim or the instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority is contested at the time when the request is made, or where the claim is not yet the subject of an instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority, in so far as precautionary measures are possible in a similar situation under the law and administrative practices of the State of the applicant authority. The document drawn up for permitting precautionary measures in the State of the applicant authority and relating to the claim for which mutual assistance is requested, if any, shall be attached to the request for precautionary measures in the State of the requested authority. This document shall not be subject to any act of recognition, supplementing or replacement in the State of the requested authority. 2. The request for precautionary measures may be accompanied by other documents relating to the claim. 1076

Article 32: Rules governing the request for precautionary measures In order to give effect to Article 31 [Request for precautionary measures], paragraph 2 of Article 25 [Request for recovery], paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 28 [Execution of the request for recovery], Articles 29 [Disputed claims and enforcement measures] and 30 [Amendment or withdrawal of the request for recovery assistance] shall apply mutatis mutandis. Article 33: Limits to the requested authority's obligation 1. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 25 [Request for recovery] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] if recovery of the claim would, because of the situation of the debtor, create serious economic or social difficulties in the State of the requested authority, in so far as the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in that State allow such exception for national claims. 2. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 25 [Request for recovery] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] where the costs or administrative burdens for the requested State would be clearly disproportionate to the monetary benefit to be derived by the applicant State. 3. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Article 20 [Request for information] and Articles 22 [Presence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] if the initial request for assistance pursuant to Article 20 [Request for information], 22 [Presence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries], 23 [Request for notification of certain documents relating to claims], 25 [Request for recovery] or 31 [Request for precautionary measures] is made in respect of claims which are more than 5 years old, dating from the due date of the claim in the State of the applicant authority to the date of the initial request for assistance. However, in cases where the claim or the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority is contested, the 5-year period shall be deemed to begin from the moment when it is established in the State of the applicant authority that the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement may no longer be contested. Moreover, in cases where a postponement of the payment or payment by instalments arrangement has been granted by the State of the applicant authority, the 5-year period shall be deemed to begin from the moment when the entire extended payment period has come to its end. However, in those cases the requested authority shall not be obliged to grant assistance in respect of claims which are more than 10 years old, dating from the due date of the claim in the State of the applicant authority. 4. A State shall not be obliged to grant assistance if the total amount for which assistance is requested is less than GBP 5000. 5. The requested authority shall inform the applicant authority of the grounds for refusing a request for assistance.

Article 34: Questions on limitation 1. Questions concerning periods of limitation shall be governed solely by the laws in force in the State of the applicant authority. 2. In relation to the suspension, interruption or prolongation of periods of limitation, any steps taken in the recovery of claims by or on behalf of the requested authority in pursuance of a request for assistance which have the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation according to the laws in force in the State of the requested authority shall have the same effect in the State of the applicant authority, on condition that the corresponding effect is provided for under the law of the latter State. If suspension, interruption or prolongation of the period of limitation is not possible under the laws in force in the State of the requested authority, any steps taken in the recovery of claims by or on behalf of the requested authority in pursuance of a request for assistance which, if they had been carried out by or on behalf of the applicant authority in its own State, would have had the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation according to the laws of that State shall be deemed to have been taken in the latter State, in so far as that effect is concerned. The first and second subparagraphs shall not affect the right of the State of the applicant authority to take measures which have the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation in accordance with the laws in force in that State. 3. The applicant authority and the requested authority shall inform each other of any action which interrupts, suspends or prolongs the limitation period of the claim for which the recovery or precautionary measures were requested, or which may have this effect. Article 35: Costs 1. In addition to the amounts referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 28 [Execution of the request for recovery], the requested authority shall seek to recover from the person concerned and retain the costs linked to the recovery that it incurred, in accordance with the laws and regulations of its State.2. The States shall renounce all claims on each other for the reimbursement of costs arising from any mutual assistance they grant each other pursuant to this Protocol. 2. However, where recovery creates a specific problem, concerns a very large amount in costs or relates to organised crime, the applicant and requested authorities may agree reimbursement arrangements specific to the cases in question. 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the State of the applicant authority shall be liable to the State of the requested authority for any costs and any losses incurred as a result of actions held to be unfounded, as far as either the substance of the claim or the validity of the instrument permitting enforcement and/or precautionary measures issued by the applicant authority are concerned. Chapter four: General rules governing all types of recovery assistance requests Article 36: Use of languages 1. All requests for assistance, standard forms for notification and uniform instruments permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority shall be sent in, or shall be accompanied by a translation into, the official language, or one of the official languages, of the State 1078

of the requested authority. The fact that certain parts thereof are written in a language other than the official language, or one of the official languages, of that State, shall not affect their validity or the validity of the procedure, in so far as that other language is one agreed between the States concerned. 2. The documents for which notification is requested pursuant to Article 23 [Request for notification of certain documents relating to claims] may be sent to the requested authority in an official language of the State of the applicant authority. 3. Where a request is accompanied by documents other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the requested authority may, where necessary, require from the applicant authority a translation of such documents into the official language, or one of the official languages of the State of the requested authority, or into any other language agreed between the States concerned. Article 37: Statistical data 1. By 30 June each year, the Parties shall communicate by electronic means to the Specialised Committee the statistical data on the application of this Title. 2. The content and format of the statistical data to be communicated under paragraph 1 shall be determined by the Specialised Committee. Article 38: Standard forms and means of communication 1. Requests pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 20 [Request for information] for information, requests pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 23 [Request for notification of certain documents relating to claims] for notification, requests pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 25 [Request for recovery] for recovery or requests pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 31 [Request for precautionary measures] for precautionary measures, and communication of statistical data pursuant to Article 37 [Statistical data] shall be sent by electronic means, using a standard form, unless this is impracticable for technical reasons. As far as possible, these forms shall also be used for any further communication with regard to the request. The uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority, the document permitting precautionary measures in the State of the applicant authority and the other documents referred to in Articles 27 [Instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority and other accompanying documents] and 31 [Request for precautionary measures] shall also be sent by electronic means, unless this is impracticable for technical reasons. Where appropriate, the standard forms may be accompanied by reports, statements and any other documents, or certified true copies or extracts thereof, which shall also be sent by electronic means, unless this is impracticable for technical reasons. Standard forms and communication by electronic means may also be used for the exchange of information pursuant to Article 21 [Exchange of information without prior request]. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the information and documentation obtained through the presence of officials in administrative offices in another State or through participation in administrative enquiries in another State, in accordance with Article 22 [Presence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries].

3. If communication is not made by electronic means or with use of standard forms, this shall not affect the validity of the information obtained or of the measures taken in the execution of a request for assistance. 4. The electronic communication network and the standard forms adopted for the implementation of this Protocol may also be used for recovery assistance regarding other claims than the claims referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of Article 2 [Scope], if such recovery assistance is possible under other bilateral or multilateral legally binding instruments on administrative cooperation between the States. 5. Pending the adoption by the Specialised Committee of the decisions referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 39 [Trade Specialised Committee on Administrative Cooperation in VAT and Recovery of Taxes and Duties], the competent authorities shall make use of the rules set out in the Annex to this Protocol, including the standard forms. 6. The State of the requested authority shall use its official currency for the transfer of the recovered amounts to the State of the applicant authority, unless otherwise agreed between the States concerned. TITLE IV: IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION Article 39: Trade Specialised Committee on Administrative cooperation in VAT and Recovery of Taxes and Duties 1. (a) (b) 2.

Section 3 : Recovery assistance Article 3.1: Communication A request sent by electronic means for the application of Title III of the Protocol shall be sent between the CCN mailboxes that are set up for the type of tax or duty to which the request relates, unless the central liaison offices of the applicant and requested States agree that one of the mailboxes can be used for requests concerning different types of taxes or duties. However, if a request for notification of documents relates to more than one type of tax or duty, the applicant authority shall send that request to a mailbox set up for at least one of the types of claims mentioned in the documents to be notified. Article 3.2: Implementing rules relating to the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State 1. The administrative penalties, fines, fees and surcharges and the interest and costs referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the Protocol which, in accordance with the rules in force in the applicant State, may be due from the date of the initial instrument permitting enforcement until the day before the date on which the recovery request is sent, may be added in the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State. 2. A single uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State may be issued in respect of several claims and several persons, corresponding to the initial instrument or instruments permitting enforcement in the applicant State. 3. In so far as initial instruments permitting enforcement for several claims in the applicant State have already been replaced by a global instrument permitting enforcement for all those claims in that State, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State may be based on the initial instruments permitting enforcement in the applicant State or on that global instrument regrouping those initial instruments in the applicant State. 4. Where the initial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 or the global instrument referred to in paragraph 3 contains several claims, one or more of which have already been collected or 1099

recovered, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State shall only refer to those claims for which recovery assistance is requested. 5. Where the initial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 or the global instrument referred to in paragraph 3 contains several claims, the applicant authority may list those claims in different uniform instruments permitting enforcement in the requested State, in line with the tax type related division of competences of the respective recovery offices in the requested State. 6. If a request cannot be transmitted by CCN network and is transmitted by post, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State shall be signed by a duly authorised official of the applicant authority. Article 3.3: Conversion of the sums to be recovered 1. The applicant authority shall express the amount of the claim to be recovered in the currency of the applicant State and in the currency of the requested State. 2. For requests sent to the United Kingdom, the exchange rate to be used for the purposes of the recovery assistance shall be the exchange rate published by the European Central Bank on the day before the date on which the request is sent. Where there is no such rate available on that date, the exchange rate used shall be the latest exchange rate published by the European Central Bank before the date the request is sent. For requests sent to a Member State, the exchange rate to be used for the purposes of the recovery assistance shall be the exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the day before the date on which the request is sent. Where there is no such rate available on that date, the exchange rate used shall be the latest exchange rate published by the Bank of England before the date the request is sent. 3. In order to convert the amount of the claim resulting from the adjustment, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 30 of the Protocol, into the currency of the State of the requested authority, the applicant authority shall use the exchange rate used in its initial request. Article 3.4: Transfer of recovered amounts 1. The transfer of the recovered amounts shall take place within two months of the date on which recovery was effected, unless otherwise agreed between the States. 2. However, if recovery measures applied by the requested authority are contested for a reason not falling within the responsibility of the applicant State, the requested authority may wait to transfer any sums recovered in relation to the applicant State's claim, until the dispute is settled, if the following conditions are simultaneously fulfilled: (a) the requested authority finds it likely that the outcome of this contestation will be favourable to the party concerned; and the applicant authority has not declared that it will reimburse the sums already transferred if the outcome of that contestation is favourable to the party concerned.

(b)

3. If the applicant authority has made a declaration to reimburse in accordance with point (b) of the second paragraph, it shall return the recovered amounts already transferred by the requested 1100

Article 3.5: Reimbursement of recovered amounts The requested authority shall notify any action taken in the requested State for reimbursement of sums recovered or for compensation in relation to recovery of contested claims to the applicant authority immediately after the requested authority has been informed of such action. The requested authority shall as far as possible involve the applicant authority in the procedures for settling the amount to be reimbursed and the compensation due. Upon receipt of a reasoned request from the requested authority, the applicant authority shall transfer the sums reimbursed and the compensation paid within two months of the receipt of that request. Article 3.6: Standard forms 1. For the uniform notification form accompanying the request for notification, referred to in Article 23 of the Protocol, the States shall use the form established in accordance with model A. 2.

Unless otherwise provided for by paragraph 2, an insured person and the members of their family staying in a State other than the competent State shall be entitled to benefits in kind, provided on behalf of the competent institution by the institution of the place of stay in accordance with its legislation, as though the person were insured under that legislation, where: (a) the benefits in kind become necessary on medical grounds during their stay, in the opinion of the provider of the benefits in kind, taking into account the nature of the benefits and the expected length of the stay; the person did not travel to that State with the purpose of receiving the benefits in kind, unless the person is a passenger or member of the crew on a vessel or aircraft travelling to that State and the benefits in kind became necessary on medical grounds during the voyage or flight; and a valid entitlement document is presented in accordance with Article SSCI.22(1) [Stay in a State other than the competent State] of Annex SSC-7 [Implementing Part].

2. Appendix SSCI-2 [Entitlement document] lists benefits in kind which, in order to be provided during a stay in another State, require for practical reasons a prior agreement between the person concerned and the institution providing the care. Article SSC.18: Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence 1. Unless otherwise provided for by this Protocol, an insured person travelling to another State with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind during the stay shall seek authorisation from the competent institution. 2. An insured person who is authorised by the competent institution to go to another State with the purpose of receiving the treatment appropriate to their condition shall receive the benefits in kind provided, on behalf of the competent institution, by the institution of the place of stay, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation it applies, as though that person were insured under the said legislation. The authorisation shall be accorded where the treatment in question is among the benefits provided for by the legislation in the State where the person concerned resides and where that person cannot be given such treatment within a time limit which is medically justifiable, taking into account their current state of health and the probable course of their illness. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the members of the family of an insured person. 4. If the members of the family of an insured person reside in a State other than the State in which the insured person resides, and this State has opted for reimbursement on the basis of fixed amounts, the cost of the benefits in kind referred to in paragraph 2 shall be borne by the institution of the place of residence of the members of the family.

An insured person and members of their family residing or staying in a State other than the competent State shall be entitled to cash benefits provided by the competent institution in accordance with the legislation it applies. By agreement between the competent institution and the institution of the place of residence or stay, such benefits may, however, be provided by the institution of the place of residence or stay at the expense of the competent institution in accordance with the legislation of the competent State. 2. The competent institution of a State whose legislation stipulates that the calculation of cash benefits shall be based on average income or on an average contribution basis shall determine such average income or average contribution basis exclusively by reference to the incomes confirmed as having been paid, or contribution bases applied, during the periods completed under the said legislation. 3. The competent institution of a State whose legislation provides that the calculation of cash benefits shall be based on standard income shall take into account exclusively the standard income or, where appropriate, the average of standard incomes for the periods completed under the said legislation. 4. Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis to cases where the legislation applied by the competent institution lays down a specific reference period which corresponds in the case in question either wholly or partly to the periods which the person concerned has completed under the legislation of one or more other States. Article SSC.20: Pension claimants 1. An insured person who, on making a claim for a pension, or during the investigation thereof, ceases to be entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State last competent, shall remain entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State in which that person resides, provided that the pension claimant satisfies the insurance conditions of the legislation of the State referred to in paragraph 2. The right to benefits in kind in the State of residence shall also apply to the members of the family of the pension claimant. 2. The benefits in kind shall be chargeable to the institution of the State which, in the event of a pension being awarded, would become competent under Articles SSC.21 [Right to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence] to SSC.23 [Pensions under the legislation of one or more States other than the State of residence, where there is a right to benefits in kind in the latter State]. Section 2: Special provisions for pensioners and members of their families Article SSC.21: Right to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence A person who receives a pension or pensions under the legislation of two or more States, of which one is the State of residence, and who is entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of that State, shall, with the members of their family, receive such benefits in kind from and at the expense of the

(a) (b) (c) A person who: resides in a State; receives a pension or pensions under the legislation of one or more States; and is not entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence,

shall nevertheless receive such benefits for themselves and the members of their family, insofar as the pensioner would be entitled to them under the legislation of the State competent in respect of their pension or at least one of the States competent, if that person resided in that State. The benefits in kind shall be provided at the expense of the institution referred to in paragraph 2 by the institution of the place of residence, as though the person concerned were entitled to a pension and entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of that State. 2. In the cases covered by paragraph 1, the cost of the benefits in kind shall be borne by the institution as determined in accordance with the following rules: (a) where the pensioner is treated as if he or she were entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of one State, the cost of those benefits shall be borne by the competent institution of that State; where the pensioner is treated as if he or she were entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of two or more States, the cost of those benefits shall be borne by the competent institution of the State to whose legislation the person has been subject for the longest period of time; if the application of the rule in subparagraph (b) would result in several States being responsible for the cost of those benefits, the cost shall be borne by the competent institution of the State to whose legislation the pensioner was last subject. Article SSC.23: Pensions under the legislation of one or more States other than the State of residence, where there is a right to benefits in kind in the latter State Where a person receiving a pension or pensions under the legislation of one or more States resides in a State under whose legislation the right to receive benefits in kind is not subject to conditions of insurance, or conditions of activity as an employed or self-employed person, and that person does not receive a pension from the State of residence, the cost of benefits in kind provided to them and to members of their family shall be borne by the institution of one of the States competent in respect of their pensions determined in accordance with Article SSC.22(2) [No right to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence], to the extent that the person and the members of their family would be entitled to such benefits if that person resided in that State.

those members of that person's family shall be entitled to receive benefits in kind from the institution of the place of their residence in accordance with the legislation it applies insofar as the pensioner is entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of a State. The costs shall be borne by the competent institution responsible for the costs of the benefits in kind provided to the pensioner in their State of residence. Article SSC.25: Stay of the pensioner or the members of their family in a State other than the State of residence ­ stay in the competent State ­ authorisation for appropriate treatment outside the State of residence 1. (a) Article SSC.17 [Stay outside the competent State] shall apply mutatis mutandis to: a person receiving a pension or pensions under the legislation of one or more States and who is entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of one of the States which provide their pension(s); the members of their family, who are staying in a State other than the one in which they reside. 2. Article SSC.16(1) [Stay in the competent State when residence is in another State ­ special rules for the members of the families of frontier workers] shall apply mutatis mutandis to the persons described in paragraph 1 when they stay in the State in which is situated the competent institution responsible for the cost of the benefits in kind provided to the pensioner in his or her State of residence and that State has opted for this and is listed in Annex SSC-3 [More rights for pensioners returning to the competent State]. 3. Article SSC.18 [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] shall apply mutatis mutandis to a pensioner or members of his or her family who are staying in a State other than the one in which they reside with the purpose of receiving in that State the treatment appropriate to their condition. 4. Unless otherwise provided for by paragraph 5, the cost of the benefits in kind referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be borne by the competent institution responsible for the cost of benefits in kind provided to the pensioner in their State of residence. 5. The cost of the benefits in kind referred to in paragraph 3 shall be borne by the institution of the place of residence of the pensioner or of the members of their family, if these persons reside in a State which has opted for reimbursement on the basis of fixed amounts. In these cases, for the purposes of paragraph 3, the institution of the place of residence of the pensioner or of the members of their family shall be considered to be the competent institution. Article SSC.26: Cash benefits for pensioners 1. Cash benefits shall be paid to a person receiving a pension or pensions under the legislation of one or more States by the competent institution of the State in which is situated the competent institution responsible for the cost of benefits in kind provided to the pensioner in their State of residence.

Paragraph 1 shall also apply to the members of a pensioner's family. Article SSC.27: Contributions by pensioners

1. The institution of a State which is responsible under the legislation it applies for making deductions in respect of contributions for sickness, maternity and equivalent paternity benefits, may request and recover such deductions, calculated in accordance with the legislation it applies, only to the extent that the cost of the benefits pursuant to Articles SSC.21 [Right to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence] to SSC.24 [Residence of members of the family in a State other than the one in which the pensioner resides] is to be borne by an institution of that State. 2. Where, in the cases referred to in Article SSC.23 [Pensions under the legislation of one or more States other than the State of residence, where there is a right to benefits in kind in the latter State], the acquisition of sickness, maternity and equivalent paternity benefits is subject to the payment of contributions or similar payments under the legislation of a State in which the pensioner concerned resides, these contributions shall not be payable by virtue of such residence. Section 3: Common provisions Article SSC.28: General provisions Articles SSC.21 [Right to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence] to SSC.27 [Contributions by pensioners] shall not apply to a pensioner or the members of their family who are entitled to benefits under the legislation of a State on the basis of an activity as an employed or selfemployed person. In such a case, the person concerned shall be subject, for the purposes of this Chapter, to Articles SSC.15 [Residence in a State other than the competent State] to SSC.19 [Cash benefits].

Unless otherwise provided for by paragraph 2, where a member of the family has an independent right to benefits in kind based on the legislation of a State or on this Chapter such right shall take priority over a derivative right to benefits in kind for members of the family. 2. Unless otherwise provided for by paragraph 3, where the independent right in the State of residence exists directly and solely on the basis of the residence of the person concerned in that State, a derivative right to benefits in kind shall take priority over the independent right. 3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, benefits in kind shall be provided to the members of the family of an insured person at the expense of the competent institution in the State in which they reside, where: (a) those members of the family reside in a State under whose legislation the right to benefits in kind is not subject to conditions of insurance or activity as an employed or self-employed person; and the spouse or the person caring for the children of the insured person pursues an activity as an employed or self-employed person in that State, or receives a pension from that State on the basis of an activity as an employed or self-employed person.

Article SSC.30: Reimbursements between institutions 1. The benefits in kind provided by the institution of a State on behalf of the institution of another State under this Chapter shall give rise to full reimbursement. 2. The reimbursements referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined and effected in accordance with the arrangements set out in Annex SSC-7 [Implementing Part], either on production of proof of actual expenditure, or on the basis of fixed amounts for States whose legal or administrative structures are such that the use of reimbursement on the basis of actual expenditure is not appropriate. 3. The States, and their competent authorities, may provide for other methods of reimbursement or waive all reimbursement between the institutions coming under their jurisdiction. CHAPTER 2: BENEFITS IN RESPECT OF ACCIDENTS AT WORK AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES Article SSC.31: Right to benefits in kind and in cash 1. Without prejudice to any more favourable provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, Articles SSC.15 [Residence in a State other than the competent State], SSC.16(1) [Stay in the competent State when residence is in another State ­ special rules for the members of the families of frontier workers], SSC.17(1) [Stay outside the competent State] and 18(1) [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] shall also apply to benefits relating to accidents at work or occupational diseases. 2. A person who has sustained an accident at work or has contracted an occupational disease and who resides or stays in a State other than the competent State shall be entitled to the special benefits in kind of the scheme covering accidents at work and occupational diseases provided, on behalf of the competent institution, by the institution of the place of residence or stay in accordance with the legislation which it applies, as though that person were insured under that legislation. 3. The competent institution may not refuse to grant the authorisation provided for in Article SSC.18(1) [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] to a person who has sustained an accident at work or who has contracted an occupational disease and is entitled to benefits chargeable to that institution, where the treatment appropriate to his or her condition cannot be given in the State in which that person resides within a time limit which is medically justifiable, taking into account that person's current state of health and the probable course of the illness. 4. Article SSC.19 [Cash benefits] also applies to benefits falling within this Chapter. Article SSC.32: Costs of transport 1. The competent institution of a State whose legislation provides for meeting the costs of transporting a person who has sustained an accident at work or is suffering from an occupational disease, either to their place of residence or to a hospital, shall meet such costs to the corresponding place in the State where the person resides, provided that that institution gives prior authorisation for such transport, duly taking into account the reasons justifying it. Such authorisation shall not be required in the case of a frontier worker. 2. The competent institution of a State whose legislation provides for meeting the costs of transporting the body of a person killed in an accident at work to the place of burial shall, in 1148

accordance with the legislation it applies, meet such costs to the corresponding place in the State where the person was residing at the time of the accident. Article SSC.33: Benefits for an occupational disease where the person suffering from such a disease has been exposed to the same risk in several States When a person who has contracted an occupational disease has, under the legislation of two or more States, pursued an activity which by its nature is likely to cause the said disease, the benefits that that person or his or her survivors may claim shall be provided exclusively under the legislation of the last of those States whose conditions are satisfied. Article SSC.34: Aggravation of an occupational disease In the event of aggravation of an occupational disease for which a person suffering from such a disease has received or is receiving benefits under the legislation of a State, the following rules shall apply: (a) if the person concerned, while in receipt of benefits, has not pursued, under the legislation of another State, an activity as an employed or self-employed person likely to cause or aggravate the disease in question, the competent institution of the first State shall bear the cost of the benefits under the provisions of the legislation which it applies, taking into account the aggravation; if the person concerned, while in receipt of benefits, has pursued such an activity under the legislation of another State, the competent institution of the first State shall bear the cost of the benefits under the legislation it applies without taking the aggravation into account. The competent institution of the second State shall grant a supplement to the person concerned, the amount of which shall be equal to the difference between the amount of benefits due after the aggravation and the amount which would have been due prior to the aggravation under the legislation it applies, if the disease in question had occurred under the legislation of that State; the rules concerning reduction, suspension or withdrawal laid down by the legislation of a State shall not be invoked against persons receiving benefits provided by institutions of two States in accordance with point (b). Article SSC.35: Rules for taking into account the special features of certain legislation 1. If there is no insurance against accidents at work or occupational diseases in the State in which the person concerned resides or stays, or if such insurance exists but there is no institution responsible for providing benefits in kind, those benefits shall be provided by the institution of the place of residence or stay responsible for providing benefits in kind in the event of sickness. 2. If there is no insurance against accidents at work or occupational diseases in the competent State, the provisions of this Chapter concerning benefits in kind shall nevertheless be applied to a person who is entitled to those benefits in the event of sickness, maternity or equivalent paternity under the legislation of that State if that person sustains an accident at work or suffers from an occupational disease during a residence or stay in another State. Costs shall be borne by the institution that is competent for the benefits in kind under the legislation of the competent State. 3. Article SSC.6 [Equal treatment of benefits, income, facts or events] shall apply to the competent institution in a State as regards the equivalence of accidents at work and occupational diseases which either have occurred or have been confirmed subsequently under the legislation of 1149

another State when assessing the degree of incapacity, the right to benefits or the amount thereof, on condition that: (a) no compensation is due in respect of an accident at work or an occupational disease which had occurred or had been confirmed previously under the legislation it applies; and no compensation is due in respect of an accident at work or an occupational disease which had occurred or had been confirmed subsequently, under the legislation of the other State under which the accident at work or the occupational disease had occurred or been confirmed. Article SSC.36: Reimbursements between institutions 1. Article SSC.30 [Reimbursements between institutions] shall also apply to benefits falling within this Chapter, and reimbursement shall be made on the basis of actual costs. 2. The States, or their competent authorities, may provide for other methods of reimbursement or waive all reimbursement between the institutions under their jurisdiction. CHAPTER 3: DEATH GRANTS Article SSC.37: Right to grants where death occurs in, or where the person entitled resides in, a State other than the competent one 1. When an insured person or a member of their family dies in a State other than the competent State, the death shall be deemed to have occurred in the competent State. 2. The competent institution shall be obliged to provide death grants payable under the legislation it applies, even if the person entitled resides in a State other than the competent State. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply when the death is the result of an accident at work or an occupational disease. Article SSC.38: Provision of benefits in the event of the death of a pensioner 1. In the event of the death of a pensioner who was entitled to a pension under the legislation of one State, or to pensions under the legislations of two or more States, when that pensioner was residing in a State other than that of the institution responsible for the cost of benefits in kind provided under Articles SSC.22 [No right to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence] and SSC.23 [Pensions under the legislation of one or more States other than the State of residence, where there is a right to benefits in kind in the latter State], the death grants payable under the legislation administered by that institution shall be provided at its own expense as though the pensioner had been residing at the time of their death in the State in which that institution is situated. 2. Paragraph 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the members of the family of a pensioner. CHAPTER 4: INVALIDITY BENEFITS Article SSC.39: Calculation of invalidity benefits Without prejudice to Article SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods], where, under the legislation of the State competent under Title II [Determination of the legislation applicable] of this Protocol, the amount of invalidity benefits is dependent on the duration of the periods of insurance, employment, self1150

employment or residence, the competent State is not required to take into account any such periods completed under the legislation of another State for the purposes of calculating the amount of invalidity benefit payable. Article SSC.40: Special provisions on aggregation of periods The competent institution of a State whose legislation makes the acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to benefits conditional upon the completion of periods of insurance or residence shall, where necessary, apply Article SSC.46 [Special provisions on aggregation of periods] mutatis mutandis. Article SSC.41: Aggravation of invalidity In the case of aggravation of an invalidity for which a person is receiving benefits under the legislation of a State in accordance with this Protocol, the benefit shall continue to be provided in accordance with this Chapter, taking the aggravation into account. Article SSC.42: Conversion of invalidity benefits into old-age benefits 1. Where provided for in the legislation of the State paying invalidity benefit in accordance with this Protocol, invalidity benefits shall be converted into old-age benefits under the conditions laid down by the legislation under which they are provided and in accordance with Chapter 5 [Old-age and survivors' pensions]. 2. Where a person receiving invalidity benefits can establish a claim to old-age benefits under the legislation of one or more other States, in accordance with Article SSC.45 [General provisions], any institution which is responsible for providing invalidity benefits under the legislation of a State shall continue to provide such a person with the invalidity benefits to which he or she is entitled under the legislation it applies until paragraph 1 becomes applicable in respect of that institution, or otherwise for as long as the person concerned satisfies the conditions for such benefits. Article SSC.43: Special provisions for civil servants Articles SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods], SSC.39 [Calculation of invalidity benefits], SSC.41 [Aggravation of invalidity], SSC.42 [Conversion of invalidity benefits into old-age benefits] and paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article SSC.55 [Special provisions for civil servants] shall apply mutatis mutandis to persons covered by a special scheme for civil servants. CHAPTER 5: OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS' PENSIONS Article SSC.44: Taking into account child-raising periods 1. Where, under the legislation of the State which is competent under Title II [Determination of the legislation applicable], no child-raising period is taken into account, the institution of the State whose legislation, according to Title II [Determination of the legislation applicable], was applicable to the person concerned on the grounds that he or she was pursuing an activity as an employed or selfemployed person at the date when, under that legislation, the child-raising period started to be taken into account for the child concerned, shall remain responsible for taking into account that period as a child-raising period under its own legislation, as if such child-raising took place in its own territory. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the person concerned is, or becomes, subject to the legislation of another State due to the pursuit of an employed or self-employed activity. 1151

Article SSC.45: General provisions 1. All the competent institutions shall determine entitlement to benefit, under all the legislations of the States to which the person concerned has been subject, when a request for award has been submitted, unless the person concerned expressly requests deferment of the award of old-age benefits under the legislation of one or more States. 2. If at a given moment the person concerned does not satisfy, or no longer satisfies, the conditions laid down by all the legislations of the States to which that person has been subject, the institutions applying legislation the conditions of which have been satisfied shall not take into account, when performing the calculation in accordance with points (a) or (b) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits], the periods completed under the legislations the conditions of which have not been satisfied, or are no longer satisfied, where this gives rise to a lower amount of benefit. 3. Paragraph 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis when the person concerned has expressly requested deferment of the award of old-age benefits. 4. A new calculation shall be performed automatically as and when the conditions to be fulfilled under the other legislations are satisfied or when a person requests the award of an old-age benefit deferred in accordance with paragraph 1, unless the periods completed under the other legislations have already been taken into account by virtue of paragraphs 2 or 3. Article SSC.46: Special provisions on aggregation of periods 1. Where the legislation of a State makes the granting of certain benefits conditional upon the periods of insurance having been completed only in a specific activity as an employed or self-employed person or in an occupation which is subject to a special scheme for employed or self-employed persons, the competent institution of that State shall take into account periods completed under the legislation of other States only if completed under a corresponding scheme or, failing that, in the same occupation, or where appropriate, in the same activity as an employed or self-employed person. If, account having been taken of the periods thus completed, the person concerned does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of the benefits of a special scheme, these periods shall be taken into account for the purposes of providing the benefits of the general scheme or, failing that, of the scheme applicable to manual or clerical workers, as the case may be, provided that the person concerned had been affiliated to one or other of those schemes. 2. The periods of insurance completed under a special scheme of a State shall be taken into account for the purposes of providing the benefits of the general scheme or, failing that, of the scheme applicable to manual or clerical workers, as the case may be, of another State, provided that the person concerned had been affiliated to one or other of those schemes, even if those periods have already been taken into account in the latter State under a special scheme. 3. Where the legislation or specific scheme of a State makes the acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to benefits conditional upon the person concerned being insured at the time of the materialisation of the risk, this condition shall be regarded as having been satisfied if that person has been previously insured under the legislation or specific scheme of that State and is, at the time of the materialisation of the risk, insured under the legislation of another State for the same risk or, failing that, if a benefit is due under the legislation of another State for the same risk. The latter condition shall, however, be deemed to be fulfilled in the cases referred to in Article SSC.52 [Periods of insurance or residence of less than one year]. 1152

Article SSC.47: Award of benefits 1. (a) The competent institution shall calculate the amount of the benefit that would be due: under the legislation it applies, only where the conditions for entitlement to benefits have been satisfied exclusively under national law (independent benefit); by calculating a theoretical amount and subsequently an actual amount (pro rata benefit), as follows: (i) the theoretical amount of the benefit is equal to the benefit which the person concerned could claim if all the periods of insurance or of residence which have been completed under the legislations of the other States had been completed under the legislation it applies on the date of the award of the benefit. If, under this legislation, the amount does not depend on the duration of the periods completed, that amount shall be regarded as being the theoretical amount; the competent institution shall then establish the actual amount of the pro rata benefit by applying to the theoretical amount the ratio between the duration of the periods completed before materialisation of the risk under the legislation it applies and the total duration of the periods completed before materialisation of the risk under the legislations of all the States concerned.

(b)

(ii)

2. Where appropriate, the competent institution shall apply, to the amount calculated in accordance with points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1, all the rules relating to reduction, suspension or withdrawal, under the legislation it applies, within the limits provided for by Articles SSC.48 [Rules to prevent overlapping] to SSC.50 [Overlapping of benefits of a different kind]. 3. The person concerned shall be entitled to receive from the competent institution of each State the higher of the amounts calculated in accordance with points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1. 4. Where the calculation pursuant to point (a) of paragraph 1 in one State invariably results in the independent benefit being equal to or higher than the pro rata benefit, calculated in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 1, the competent institution shall waive the pro rata calculation, provided that: (a) such a situation is set out in Part 1 of Annex SSC-4 [Cases in which the pro rata calculation shall be waived or shall not apply]. no legislation containing rules against overlapping, as referred to in Articles SSC.49 [Overlapping of benefits of the same kind] and SSC.50 [Overlapping of benefits of a different kind], is applicable unless the conditions laid down in Article SSC.50(2) [Overlapping of benefits of a different kind], are fulfilled; and Article SSC.52 [Periods of insurance or residence of less than one year] is not applicable in relation to periods completed under the legislation of another State in the specific circumstances of the case.

(b)

(c)

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the pro rata calculation shall not apply to schemes providing benefits in respect of which periods of time are of no relevance to the calculation, subject to such schemes being listed in part 2 of Annex SSC-4 [Cases in which the pro rata 1153

calculation shall be waived or shall not apply]. In such cases, the person concerned shall be entitled to the benefit calculated in accordance with the legislation of the State concerned. Article SSC.48: Rules to prevent overlapping 1. Any overlapping of old-age and survivors' benefits calculated or provided on the basis of periods of insurance or residence completed by the same person shall be considered to be overlapping of benefits of the same kind. 2. Overlapping of benefits which cannot be considered to be of the same kind within the meaning of paragraph 1 shall be considered to be overlapping of benefits of a different kind. 3. The following provisions shall be applicable for the purposes of rules to prevent overlapping laid down by the legislation of a State in the case of overlapping of a benefit in respect of old-age or survivors with a benefit of the same kind or a benefit of a different kind or with other income: (a) the competent institution shall take into account the benefits or incomes acquired in another State only where the legislation it applies provides for benefits or income acquired abroad to be taken into account; the competent institution shall take into account the amount of benefits to be paid by another State before deduction of tax, social security contributions and other individual levies or deductions, unless the legislation it applies provides for the application of rules to prevent overlapping after such deductions, under the conditions and the procedures laid down in Annex SSC-7 [Implementing Part]; the competent institution shall not take into account the amount of benefits acquired under the legislation of another State on the basis of voluntary insurance or continued optional insurance; if a single State applies rules to prevent overlapping because the person concerned receives benefits of the same or of a different kind under the legislation of other States or income acquired in other States, the benefit due may be reduced solely by the amount of such benefits or such income. Article SSC.49: Overlapping of benefits of the same kind 1. Where benefits of the same kind due under the legislation of two or more States overlap, the rules to prevent overlapping laid down by the legislation of a State shall not be applicable to a pro rata benefit. 2. The rules to prevent overlapping shall apply to an independent benefit only if the benefit concerned is: (a) a benefit the amount of which does not depend on the duration of periods of insurance or residence; or a benefit the amount of which is determined on the basis of a credited period deemed to have been completed between the date on which the risk materialised and a later date, overlapping with:

(i)

a benefit of the same type, except where an agreement has been concluded between two or more States to avoid the same credited period being taken into account more than once; or a benefit referred to in point (a).

(ii)

The benefits and agreements referred to in points (a) and (b) are listed in Annex SSC-5 [Benefits and agreements which allow the application of Article SSC.49 [Overlapping of benefits of the same kind]]. Article SSC.50: Overlapping of benefits of a different kind 1. If the receipt of benefits of a different kind or other income requires the application of the rules to prevent overlapping provided for by the legislation of the States concerned regarding: (a) two or more independent benefits, the competent institutions shall divide the amounts of the benefit or benefits or other income, as they have been taken into account, by the number of benefits subject to the said rules; however, the application of this subparagraph cannot deprive the person concerned of their status as a pensioner for the purposes of the other chapters of this Title under the conditions and the procedures laid down in Annex SSC-7 [Implementing Part]; (b) one or more pro rata benefits, the competent institutions shall take into account the benefit or benefits or other income and all the elements stipulated for applying the rules to prevent overlapping as a function of the ratio between the periods of insurance or residence established for the calculation referred to in point (b)(ii) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits]; one or more independent benefits and one or more pro rata benefits, the competent institutions shall apply mutatis mutandis point (a) as regards independent benefits and point (b) as regards pro rata benefits.

(c)

2. The competent institution shall not apply the division stipulated in respect of independent benefits, if the legislation it applies provides for account to be taken of benefits of a different kind or other income and all other elements for calculating part of their amount determined as a function of the ratio between periods of insurance or residence referred to in point (b)(ii) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits]. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis where the legislation of one or more States provides that a right to a benefit cannot be acquired in the case where the person concerned is in receipt of a benefit of a different kind, payable under the legislation of another State, or of other income. Article SSC.51: Additional provisions for the calculation of benefits 1. For the calculation of the theoretical and pro rata amounts referred to in point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits], the following rules shall apply: (a) where the total length of the periods of insurance or residence completed before the risk materialised under the legislations of all the States concerned is longer than the maximum period required by the legislation of one of these States for receipt of full benefit, the competent institution of that State shall take into account this maximum period instead of the total length of the periods completed; this method of calculation shall not result in the imposition on that 1155

institution of the cost of a benefit greater than the full benefit provided for by the legislation it applies. This provision shall not apply to benefits the amount of which does not depend on the length of insurance; (b) the procedure for taking into account overlapping periods is laid down in Annex SSC-7 [Implementing Part]; if the legislation of a State provides that the benefits are to be calculated on the basis of incomes, contributions, bases of contributions, increases, earnings, other amounts or a combination of more than one of them (average, proportional, fixed or credited), the competent institution shall: (i) determine the basis for calculation of the benefits in accordance only with periods of insurance completed under the legislation it applies; use, in order to determine the amount to be calculated in accordance with the periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of the other States, the same elements determined or recorded for the periods of insurance completed under the legislation it applies; where necessary in accordance with the procedures laid down in Annex SSC-6 [Special provisions for the application of the legislation of the Member States and of the United Kingdom] for the State concerned; (d) in the event that point (c) is not applicable because the legislation of a State provides for the benefit to be calculated on the basis of elements other than periods of insurance or residence which are not linked to time, the competent institution shall take into account, in respect of each period of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of any other State, the amount of the capital accrued, the capital which is considered as having been accrued or any other element for the calculation under the legislation it administers divided by the corresponding units of periods in the pension scheme concerned.

(c)

(ii)

2. The provisions of the legislation of a State concerning the revalorisation of the elements taken into account for the calculation of benefits shall apply, as appropriate, to the elements to be taken into account by the competent institution of that State, in accordance with paragraph 1, in respect of the periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of other States. Article SSC.52: Periods of insurance or residence of less than one year 1. Notwithstanding point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits], the institution of a State shall not be required to provide benefits in respect of periods completed under the legislation it applies which are taken into account when the risk materialises, if: (a) (b) the duration of the said periods is less than one year, and taking only these periods into account no right to benefit is acquired under that legislation.

For the purposes of this Article, `periods' shall mean all periods of insurance, employment, selfemployment or residence which either qualify for, or directly increase, the benefit concerned. 2. The competent institution of each of the States concerned shall take into account the periods referred to in paragraph 1, for the purposes of point (b)(i) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits]. 1156
24.12.2020

This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only. No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional.

3. If the effect of applying paragraph 1 would be to relieve all the institutions of the States concerned of their obligations, benefits shall be provided exclusively under the legislation of the last of those States whose conditions are satisfied, as if all the periods of insurance and residence completed and taken into account in accordance with Articles SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods] and SSC.46(1) and (2) [Special provisions on aggregation of periods] had been completed under the legislation of that State. 4. This Article shall not apply to schemes listed in Part 2 [Cases in which Article 47(5) applies] of Annex SSC-4 [Cases in which the pro rata calculation shall be waived or shall not apply]. Article SSC.53: Award of a supplement 1. A recipient of benefits to whom this Chapter applies may not, in the State of residence and under whose legislation a benefit is payable to them, be provided with a benefit which is less than the minimum benefit fixed by that legislation for a period of insurance or residence equal to all the periods taken into account for the payment in accordance with this Chapter. 2. The competent institution of that State shall pay them throughout the period of their residence in its territory a supplement equal to the difference between the total of the benefits due under this Chapter and the amount of the minimum benefit. Article SSC.54: Recalculation and revaluation of benefits 1. If the method for determining benefits or the rules for calculating benefits are altered under the legislation of a State, or if the personal situation of the person concerned undergoes a relevant change which, under that legislation, would lead to an adjustment of the amount of the benefit, a recalculation shall be carried out in accordance with Article SSC.47 [Award of benefits]. 2. On the other hand, if, by reason of an increase in the cost of living or changes in the level of income or other grounds for adjustment, the benefits of the State concerned are altered by a percentage or fixed amount, such percentage or fixed amount shall be applied directly to the benefits determined in accordance with Article SSC.47 [Award of benefits], without the need for a recalculation. Article SSC.55: Special provisions for civil servants 1. Articles SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods], SSC.45 [General provisions], SSC.46(3) [Special provisions on aggregation of periods] and SSC.47 [Award of benefits] to SSC.54 [Recalculation and revaluation of benefits] shall apply mutatis mutandis to persons covered by a special scheme for civil servants. 2. However, if the legislation of a competent State makes the acquisition, liquidation, retention or recovery of the right to benefits under a special scheme for civil servants subject to the condition that all periods of insurance be completed under one or more special schemes for civil servants in that State, or be regarded by the legislation of that State as equivalent to such periods, the competent institution of that State shall take into account only the periods which can be recognised under the legislation it applies. If, account having been taken of the periods thus completed, the person concerned does not satisfy the conditions for the receipt of these benefits, these periods shall be taken into account for the award of benefits under the general scheme or, failing that, the scheme applicable to manual or clerical workers, as the case may be. 1157

3. Where, under the legislation of a State, benefits under a special scheme for civil servants are calculated on the basis of the last salary or salaries received during a reference period, the competent institution of that State shall take into account, for the purposes of the calculation, only those salaries, duly revalued, which were received during the period or periods for which the person concerned was subject to that legislation. CHAPTER 6: UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Article SSC.56: Special provisions on aggregation of periods of insurance, employment or selfemployment 1. The competent institution of a State whose legislation makes the acquisition, retention, recovery or duration of the right to benefits conditional upon the completion of either periods of insurance, employment or self-employment shall, to the extent necessary, take into account periods of insurance, employment or self-employment completed under the legislation of any other State as though they were completed under the legislation it applies. However, when the applicable legislation makes the right to benefits conditional on the completion of periods of insurance, the periods of employment or self-employment completed under the legislation of another State shall not be taken into account unless such periods would have been considered to be periods of insurance had they been completed in accordance with the applicable legislation. 2. The application of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be conditional on the person concerned having the most recently completed, in accordance with the legislation under which the benefits are claimed: (a) (b) (c) periods of insurance, if that legislation requires periods of insurance, periods of employment, if that legislation requires periods of employment, or periods of self-employment, if that legislation requires periods of self-employment. Article SSC.57: Calculation of unemployment benefits 1. Where the calculation of unemployment benefits is based on the amount of the previous salary or professional income of the person concerned, the competent State shall take into account the salary or professional income received by the person concerned based exclusively on their last activity as an employed or self-employed person under the legislation of the competent State. 2. Where the legislation applied by the competent State provides for a specific reference period for the determination of the salary or professional income used to calculate the amount of benefit, and the person concerned was subject to the legislation of another State for all or part of that reference period, the competent State shall only take into account the salary or professional income received during their last activity as an employed or self-employed person under that legislation.

Article SSC.58: Benefits When the applicable legislation makes the right to pre-retirement benefits conditional on the completion of periods of insurance, of employment or of self-employment, Article SSC.7 [ Aggregation of periods] shall not apply. TITLE IV: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS Article SSC.59: Cooperation 1. The competent authorities of the States shall notify the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination of any changes to their legislation as regards the branches of social security covered by Article SSC.3 [Matters covered] which are relevant to or may affect the implementation of this Protocol. 2. Unless this Protocol requires such information to be notified to the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination, the competent authorities of the States shall communicate to each other measures taken to implement this Protocol that are not notified under paragraph 1 and that are relevant for the implementation of the Protocol. 3. For the purposes of this Protocol, the authorities and institutions of the Member States and of the United Kingdom shall lend one another their good offices and act as though implementing their own legislation. The administrative assistance given by the said authorities and institutions shall, as a rule, be free of charge. However, the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall establish the nature of reimbursable expenses and the limits above which their reimbursement is due. 4. The authorities and institutions of the States may, for the purposes of this Protocol, communicate directly with one another and with the persons involved or their representatives. 5. The institutions and persons covered by this Protocol shall have a duty of mutual information and cooperation to ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol. The institutions, in accordance with the principle of good administration, shall respond to all queries within a reasonable period of time and shall in this connection provide the persons concerned with any information required for exercising the rights conferred on them by this Protocol. The persons concerned must inform the institutions of the competent State and of the State of residence as soon as possible of any change in their personal or family situation which affects their right to benefits under this Protocol. 6. Failure to respect the obligation of information referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 5 may result in the application of proportionate measures in accordance with national law. Nevertheless, these measures shall be equivalent to those applicable to similar situations under domestic law and shall not make it impossible or excessively difficult in practice for claimants to exercise the rights conferred on them by this Protocol. 7. In the event of difficulties in the interpretation or application of this Protocol which could jeopardise the rights of a person covered by it, the institution of the competent State or of the State of residence of the person concerned, shall contact the institution(s) of the State(s) concerned. If a solution cannot be found within a reasonable period, a Party may request to hold consultations in the framework of the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination. 1159

Each State shall be responsible for managing its own part of the data-processing services.

3. An electronic document sent or issued by an institution in conformity with the Protocol and Annex SSC-7 [Implementing Part] may not be rejected by any authority or institution of another State on the grounds that it was received by electronic means, once the receiving institution has declared that it can receive electronic documents. Reproduction and recording of such documents shall be presumed to be a correct and accurate reproduction of the original document or representation of the information it relates to, unless there is proof to the contrary. 4. An electronic document shall be considered valid if the computer system on which the document is recorded contains the safeguards necessary in order to prevent any alteration, disclosure or unauthorised access to the recording. It shall at any time be possible to reproduce the recorded information in an immediately readable form. Article SSC.61: Exemptions 1. Any exemption from or reduction of taxes, stamp duty, notarial or registration fees provided for under the legislation of one State in respect of certificates or documents required to be produced in application of the legislation of that State shall be extended to similar certificates or documents required to be produced in application of the legislation of another State or of this Protocol. 2. All statements, documents and certificates of any kind whatsoever required to be produced in application of this Protocol shall be exempt from authentication by diplomatic or consular authorities. Article SSC.62: Claims, declarations or appeals Any claim, declaration or appeal which should have been submitted, in application of the legislation of one State, within a specified period to an authority, institution or tribunal of that State shall be admissible if it is submitted within the same period to a corresponding authority, institution or tribunal of another State. In such a case, the authority, institution or tribunal receiving the claim, declaration or appeal shall forward it without delay to the competent authority, institution or tribunal of the former State either directly or through the competent authorities of the States concerned. The date on which such claims, declarations or appeals were submitted to the authority, institution or tribunal of the second State shall be considered as the date of their submission to the competent authority, institution or tribunal. Article SSC.63: Medical examinations 1. Medical examinations provided for by the legislation of one State may be carried out, at the request of the competent institution, in the territory of another State, by the institution of the place of stay or residence of the person entitled to benefits, under the conditions laid down in Annex SSC-7 [Implementing Part] or agreed between the competent authorities of the States concerned. 1160

Enforceable decisions of the judicial and administrative authorities relating to the collection of contributions, interest and any other charges or to the recovery of benefits provided but not due under the legislation of one State shall be recognised and enforced at the request of the competent institution in another State within the limits and in accordance with the procedures laid down by the legislation and any other procedures applicable to similar decisions of the latter. Such decisions shall be declared enforceable in that State insofar as the legislation and any other procedures of that State so require. 3. Claims of an institution of one State shall in enforcement, bankruptcy or settlement proceedings in another State enjoy the same privileges as the legislation that the latter accords to claims of the same kind. 4. The procedure for implementing this Article, including costs reimbursement, shall be governed by Annex SSC-7 [Implementing Part] or, where necessary and as a complementary measure, by means of agreements between the States. Article SSC.65: Rights of institutions 1. If a person receives benefits under the legislation of a State in respect of an injury resulting from events occurring in another State, any rights of the institution responsible for providing benefits against a third party liable to provide compensation for the injury shall be governed by the following rules: (a) where the institution responsible for providing benefits is, under the legislation it applies, subrogated to the rights which the beneficiary has against the third party, such subrogation shall be recognised by each State; where the institution responsible for providing benefits has a direct right against the third party, each State shall recognise such rights.

(b)

2. If a person receives benefits under the legislation of one State in respect of an injury resulting from events occurring in another State, the provisions of the said legislation which determine the cases in which the civil liability of employers or of their employees is to be excluded shall apply with regard to the said person or to the competent institution. Paragraph 1 shall also apply to any rights of the institution responsible for providing benefits against employers or their employees in cases where their liability is not excluded. 3. Where, in accordance with Articles SSC.30(3) [Reimbursements between institutions] or 36(2) [Reimbursements between institutions], two or more States or their competent authorities have concluded an agreement to waive reimbursement between institutions under their jurisdiction, or, 1161

where reimbursement does not depend on the amount of benefits actually provided, any rights arising against a liable third party shall be governed by the following rules: (a) where the institution of the State of residence or stay grants benefits to a person in respect of an injury sustained in its territory, that institution, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation it applies, shall exercise the right to subrogation or direct action against the third party liable to provide compensation for the injury; for the application of (a): (i) the person receiving benefits shall be deemed to be insured with the institution of the place of residence or stay, and that institution shall be deemed to be the institution responsible for providing benefits;

For the calculation of the pro rata benefit referred to in point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits], special increments for contributions for supplementary insurance and the miners' supplementary benefit under Austrian legislation shall be disregarded. In those cases the pro rata benefit calculated without those contributions shall, if appropriate, be increased by unreduced special increments for contributions for supplementary insurance and the miners' supplementary benefit. 3. Where pursuant to Article SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods] of the Protocol substitute periods under an Austrian pension insurance scheme have been completed but cannot form a basis for calculation pursuant to Articles 238 and 239 of the ASVG, Articles 122 and 123 of the GSVG and Articles 113 and 114 of the BSVG, the calculation basis for periods of childcare pursuant to Article 239 of the ASVG, Article 123 of the GSVG and Article 114 of the BSVG shall be used.

For the purposes of defining members of the family in accordance with point (s) of Article SSC.1 [Definitions] of the Protocol, `spouse' includes registered partners as defined in the Czech act no. 115/2006 Coll., on registered partnership. DENMARK 1. (a) For the purpose of calculating the pension under the `lov om social pension' (Social Pension Act), periods of activity as an employed or self-employed person completed under Danish legislation by a frontier worker or a worker who has gone to Denmark to do work of a seasonal nature are regarded as periods of residence completed in Denmark by the surviving spouse in so far as, during those periods, the surviving spouse was linked to the abovementioned worker by marriage without separation from bed and board or de facto separation on grounds of incompatibility, and provided that, during those periods, the spouse resided in the territory of another State. For the purposes of this point, `work of a seasonal nature' means work which, being dependent on the succession of the seasons, automatically recurs each year. For the purpose of calculating the pension under the `lov om social pension' (Social Pension Act), periods of activity as an employed or self-employed person completed under Danish legislation before 1 January 1984 by a person to whom point (a) does not apply shall be regarded as periods of residence completed in Denmark by the surviving spouse, in so far as, during those periods, the surviving spouse was linked to that person by marriage without separation from bed and board or de facto separation on grounds of incompatibility, and provided that, during those periods, the spouse resided in the territory of another State. Periods to be taken into account under points (a) and (b) shall not be taken into consideration if they coincide with the periods taken into account for the calculation of the pension due to the person concerned under the legislation on compulsory insurance of another State, or with the periods during which the person concerned received a pension under such legislation. Those periods shall, however, be taken into consideration if the annual amount of the said pension is less than half the basic amount of the social pension.

(c)

2. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods] of the Protocol, persons who have not been gainfully employed in one or more States are entitled to a Danish social pension only if they have been, or have previously been, permanent residents of Denmark for at least 3 years, subject to the age limits prescribed by Danish legislation. Subject to Article SSC.5 [Equality of treatment] of the Protocol, Article SSC.8 [Waiving of residence rules] of the Protocol does not apply to a Danish social pension to which entitlement has been acquired by such persons. The provisions referred to in point (a) do not apply to Danish social pension entitlement for the members of the family of persons who are or have been gainfully employed in Denmark, or for students or the members of their families.

[Unemployment Benefits] of Title III [Special provisions concerning the various categories of benefits] of the Protocol. 4. Where the beneficiary of a Danish social pension is also entitled to a survivor's pension from another State, those pensions for the implementation of Danish legislation shall be regarded as benefits of the same kind within the meaning of Article SSC.48(1) [Rules to prevent overlapping], subject to the condition, however, that the person whose periods of insurance or of residence serve as the basis for the calculation of the survivor's pension had also acquired a right to a Danish social pension. ESTONIA For the purpose of calculating parental benefits, periods of employment in States other than Estonia shall be considered to be based on the same average amount of Social Tax as paid during the periods of employment in Estonia with which they are aggregated. If during the reference year the person has been employed only in other States, the calculation of the benefit shall be considered to be based on the average Social Tax paid in Estonia between the reference year and the maternity leave. FINLAND 1. For the purposes of determining entitlement and of calculating the amount of the Finnish national pension under Articles SSC.47 [Award of benefits] to 49 [Overlapping of benefits of the same kind], pensions acquired under the legislation of another State are treated in the same way as pensions acquired under Finnish legislation. 2. When applying point (b)(i) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits] for the purpose of calculating earnings for the credited period under Finnish legislation on earnings-related pensions, where an individual has pension insurance periods based on activity as an employed or self-employed person in another State for part of the reference period under Finnish legislation, the earnings for the credited period shall be equivalent to the sum of earnings obtained during the part of the reference period in Finland, divided by the number of months for which there were insurance periods in Finland during the reference period. FRANCE 1. For persons receiving benefits in kind in France pursuant to Articles SSC.15 [Residence in a State other than the competent State], SSC.24 [Residence of members of the family in a State other than the one in which the pensioner resides] of the Protocol who are resident in the French departments of Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin or Moselle, benefits in kind provided on behalf of the institution of another State which is responsible for bearing their cost include benefits provided by both the general sickness insurance scheme and the obligatory supplementary local sickness insurance scheme of Alsace-Moselle. 2. French legislation applicable to a person engaged, or formerly engaged, in an activity as an employed or self-employed person for the application of Chapter 5 [Old-age and survivors' pensions] of Title III [Special provisions concerning the various categories of benefits] includes both the basic old-age insurance scheme(s) and the supplementary retirement scheme(s) to which the person concerned was subject.

Notwithstanding point (a) of Article SSC.6 [Equal treatment of benefits, income, facts or events] of the Protocol and Article 7 of the Sozialgesetzbuch VI (Volume VI of the Social Code), a person who is compulsorily insured in another State, or receives an old-age pension under the legislation of another State may join the voluntary insurance scheme in Germany. 3. For the purpose of granting cash benefits under §47(1) of SGB V, §47(1) of SGB VII and §200(2) of the Reichsversicherungsordnung to insured persons who live in another State, German insurance schemes calculate net pay, which is used to assess benefits, as if the insured person lived in Germany, unless the insured person requests an assessment on the basis of the net pay which he actually receives. 4. Nationals of other States whose place of residence or usual abode is outside Germany and who fulfil the general conditions of the German pension insurance scheme may pay voluntary contributions only if they had been voluntarily or compulsorily insured in the German pension insurance scheme at some time previously; this also applies to stateless persons and refugees whose place of residence or usual abode is in another State. 5. The pauschale Anrechnungszeit (fixed credit period) pursuant to Article 253 of the Sozialgesetzbuch VI (Volume VI of the Social Code) shall be determined exclusively with reference to German periods. 6. In cases where the German pension legislation, in force on 31 December 1991, is applicable for the recalculation of a pension, only the German legislation applies for the purposes of crediting German Ersatzzeiten (substitute periods). 7. The German legislation on accidents at work and occupational diseases to be compensated for under the law governing foreign pensions and on benefits for insurance periods which can be credited under the law governing foreign pensions in the territories named in paragraph 1(2)(3) of the Act on affairs of displaced persons and refugees (Bundesvertriebenengesetz) continues to apply within the scope of application of the Protocol, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of the Act on foreign pensions (Fremdrentengesetz). 8. For the calculation of the theoretical amount referred to in point (b)(i) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits], in pension schemes for liberal professions, the competent institution shall take as a basis, in respect of each of the years of insurance completed under the legislation of any other State, the average annual pension entitlement acquired during the period of membership of the competent institution through the payment of contributions. GREECE 1. Law No 1469/84 concerning voluntary affiliation to the pension insurance scheme for Greek nationals and foreign nationals of Greek origin is applicable to nationals of other States, stateless persons and refugees, where the persons concerned, regardless of their place of residence or stay, have at some time in the past been compulsorily or voluntarily affiliated to the Greek pension insurance scheme. 2 Notwithstanding point (a) of Article SSC.6 [Equal treatment of benefits, income, facts or events] of the Protocol and Article 34 of Law 1140/1981, a person who receives a pension in respect 1192

IRELAND 1. Notwithstanding Articles SSC.19(2) [Cash benefits] and SSC.57 [Calculation of unemployment benefits], for the purposes of calculating the prescribed reckonable weekly earnings of an insured person for the grant of sickness or unemployment benefit under Irish legislation, an amount equal to the average weekly wage of employed persons in the relevant prescribed year shall be credited to that insured person in respect of each week of activity as an employed person under the legislation of another State during that prescribed year. MALTA Special provisions for civil servants (a) Solely for the purposes of the application of Articles SSC.43 [Special provisions for civil servants] and SSC.55 [Special provisions for civil servants] of the Protocol, persons employed under the Malta Armed Forces Act (Chapter 220 of the Laws of Malta), the Police Act (Chapter 164 of the Laws of Malta) and the Prisons Act (Chapter 260 of the Laws of Malta) shall be treated as civil servants; Pensions payable under the above Acts and under the Pensions Ordinance (Chapter 93 of the Laws of Malta) shall, solely for the purposes of point (cc) of Article SSC.1 [Definitions] of the Protocol, be considered as `special schemes for civil servants'. NETHERLANDS 1.

1. For the purpose of implementing point (1)(b) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits] of the Protocol, the years which the worker lacks to reach the pensionable or compulsory retirement age as stipulated under Article 31(4) of the consolidated version of the Ley de Clases Pasivas del Estado (Law on State Pensioners) shall be taken into account as actual years of service to the State only if at the time of the event in respect of which death pensions are due, the beneficiary was covered by Spain's special scheme for civil servants or was performing an activity assimilated under the scheme, or if, at the time of the event in respect of which the pensions are due, the beneficiary was performing an activity that would have required the person concerned to be included under the State's special scheme for civil servants, the armed forces or the judiciary, had the activity been performed in Spain. 2. (a) Under point (1)(c) of Article SSC.51 [Additional provisions for the calculation of benefits], the calculation of the theoretical Spanish benefit shall be carried out on the basis of the actual contributions of the person during the years immediately preceding payment of the last contribution to Spanish social security. Where, in the calculation of the basic amount for the pension, periods of insurance or residence under the legislation of other States have to be taken into account, the contribution basis in Spain which is closest in time to the reference periods shall be used for those periods, taking into account the development of the retail price index. The amount of the pension obtained shall be increased by the amount of the increases and revaluations calculated for each subsequent year for pensions of the same nature.

The additional amounts based on age referred to in the Second Transitional Provision of the General Law on Social Security shall be applicable to all beneficiaries under the Protocol who have contributions to their name under the Spanish legislation prior to 1 January 1967; it shall not be possible, by application of Article SSC.6 [Equal treatment of benefits, income, facts or events] of the Protocol, to treat periods of insurance credited in another State prior to 1 January 1967 as being the same as contributions paid in Spain, solely for the purposes of the Protocol. The date corresponding to 1 January 1967 shall be 1 August 1970 for the Special Scheme for Seafarers and 1 April 1969 for the Special Social Security Scheme for Coal Mining. SWEDEN 1. The provisions of the Protocol on the aggregation of insurance periods and periods of residence shall not apply to the transitional provisions in the Swedish legislation on entitlement to guarantee pension for persons born in or before 1937 who have been resident in Sweden for a specified period before applying for a pension (Act 2000:798). 2. For the purpose of calculating income for notional income-related sickness compensation and income-related activity compensation in accordance with Chapter 8 of the Lag (1962:381) om allmän försäkring (the National Insurance Act), the following shall apply: (a) where the insured person, during the reference period, has also been subject to the legislation of one or more other States on account of activity as an employed or self-employed person, income in the State(s) concerned shall be deemed to be equivalent to the insured person's average gross income in Sweden during the part of the reference period in Sweden, calculated by dividing the earnings in Sweden by the number of years over which those earnings accrued;

3. (a) For the purpose of calculating notional pension assets for income-based survivor's pension (Act 2000:461), if the requirement in Swedish legislation for pension entitlement in respect of at least three out of the 5 calendar years immediately preceding the insured person's death (reference period) is not met, account shall also be taken of insurance periods completed in other States as if they had been completed in Sweden. Insurance periods in other States shall be regarded as based on the average Swedish pension base. If the person concerned has only 1 year in Sweden with a pension base, each insurance period in another State shall be regarded as constituting the same amount. For the purpose of calculating notional pension credits for widows' pensions relating to deaths on or after 1 January 2003, if the requirement in Swedish legislation for pension credits in respect of at least two out of the 4 years immediately preceding the insured person's death (reference period) is not met and insurance periods were completed in another State during the reference period, those years shall be regarded as being based on the same pension credits as the Swedish year.

The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall seek to reconcile the points of view within six months of the date on which the matter was brought before it. 4. Where it is established either that the applicable legislation is not that of the State of provisional membership, or the institution which granted the benefits on a provisional basis was not the competent institution, the institution identified as being competent shall be deemed retroactively to have been so, as if that difference of views had not existed, at the latest from either the date of provisional membership or of the first provisional granting of the benefits concerned. 5. If necessary, the institution identified as being competent and the institution which provisionally paid the cash benefits or provisionally received contributions shall settle the financial situation of the person concerned as regards contributions and cash benefits paid provisionally, where appropriate, in accordance with Title IV, Chapter 2 [Recovery of benefits provided but not due, recovery of provisional payments and contributions, offsetting and assistance with recovery], of this Annex.

Unless otherwise provided for in this Annex to the Protocol, where a person is eligible for a benefit, or is liable to pay a contribution in accordance with the Protocol, and the competent institution does not have all the information concerning the situation in another State which is necessary to calculate definitively the amount of that benefit or contribution, that institution shall, on request of the person concerned, award this benefit or calculate this contribution on a provisional basis, if such a calculation is possible on the basis of the information at the disposal of that institution. 2. The benefit or the contribution concerned shall be recalculated once all the necessary supporting evidence or documents are provided to the institution concerned.

Any agreements concluded to this end shall be notified to the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination and listed in the Appendix SSCI-1 [Implementing provisions for bilateral agreements remaining in force and new bilateral implementing agreements]. 3. Provisions contained in implementing agreements concluded between two or more States with the same purpose as, or which are similar to, those referred to in paragraph 2, which are in force on the day preceding the entry into force of this Agreement, shall continue to apply, for the purposes of relations between those States, provided they are also included in Appendix SSCI-1 [Implementing provisions for bilateral agreements remaining in force and new bilateral implementing agreements]. Article SSCI.9 : Prevention of overlapping of benefits Notwithstanding other provisions in the Protocol, when benefits due under the legislation of two or more States are mutually reduced, suspended or withdrawn, any amounts that would not be paid in the event of strict application of the rules concerning reduction, suspension or withdrawal laid down by the legislation of the State concerned shall be divided by the number of benefits subjected to reduction, suspension or withdrawal. Article SSCI.10: Elements for determining residence 1. Where there is a difference of views between the institutions of two or more States about the determination of the residence of a person to whom the Protocol applies, these institutions shall establish by common agreement the centre of interests of the person concerned, based on an overall assessment of all available information relating to relevant facts, which may include, as appropriate: (a) (b) the duration and continuity of presence on the territory of the States concerned; that person's situation, including: (i) the nature and the specific characteristics of any activity pursued, in particular the place where such activity is habitually pursued, the stability of the activity, and the duration of any work contract; that person's family status and family ties; the exercise of any non-remunerated activity; in the case of students, the source of that student's income; that person's housing situation, in particular how permanent it is; the State in which that person is deemed to reside for taxation purposes.

(ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi)

2. Where the consideration of the various criteria based on relevant facts as set out in paragraph 1 does not lead to agreement between the institutions concerned, the person's intention, as it appears 1206

from such facts and circumstances, especially the reasons that led the person to move, shall be considered to be decisive for establishing that person's actual place of residence. 3. The centre of interest of a student who goes to another State to pursue a full time course of study shall not be considered as being in the State of study for the entire duration of the course of study in that State, without prejudice to the possibility of rebutting this presumption. 4. Paragraph 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the family members of the student. Article SSCI.11: Aggregation of periods 1. For the purposes of applying Article SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods] of the Protocol the competent institution shall contact the institutions of the States to whose legislation the person concerned has also been subject in order to determine all the periods completed under their legislation. 2. The respective periods of insurance, employment, self-employment or residence completed under the legislation of a State shall be added to those completed under the legislation of any other State, insofar as necessary for the purposes of applying Article SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods] of the Protocol, provided that these periods do not overlap. 3. Where a period of insurance or residence which is completed in accordance with compulsory insurance under the legislation of a State coincides with a period of insurance completed on the basis of voluntary insurance or continued optional insurance under the legislation of another State, only the period completed on the basis of compulsory insurance shall be taken into account. 4. Where a period of insurance or residence other than an equivalent period completed under the legislation of a State coincides with an equivalent period on the basis of the legislation of another State, only the period other than an equivalent period shall be taken into account. 5. Any period regarded as equivalent under the legislation of two or more States shall be taken into account only by the institution of the State to whose legislation the person concerned was last compulsorily subject before that period. In the event that the person concerned was not compulsorily subject to the legislation of a State before that period, the latter shall be taken into account by the institution of the State to whose legislation the person concerned was compulsorily subject for the first time after that period. 6. In the event that the time in which certain periods of insurance or residence were completed under the legislation of a State cannot be determined precisely, it shall be presumed that these periods do not overlap with periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of another State, and account shall be taken thereof, where advantageous to the person concerned, insofar as they can reasonably be taken into consideration. Article SSCI.12: Rules for conversion of periods 1. Where periods completed under the legislation of a State are expressed in units different from those provided for by the legislation of another State, the conversion needed for the purpose of aggregation under Article SSC.7 [Aggregation of periods] of the Protocol shall be carried out under the following rules: (a) the period to be used as the basis for the conversion shall be that communicated by the institution of the State under whose legislation the period was completed; 1207

(b)

in the case of schemes where the periods are expressed in days the conversion from days to other units, and vice versa, as well as between different schemes based on days shall be calculated according to the following table: Scheme based on 1 day 1 week 1 month 1 quarter Maximum of corresponds corresponds corresponds corresponds days in one to to to to calendar year 9 hours 8 hours 6 hours 5 days 6 days 7 days 22 days 26 days 30 days 66 days 78 days 90 days 264 days 312 days 360 days

5 days 6 days 7 days (c)

in the case of schemes where the periods are expressed in units other than days, (i) (ii) (iii) three months or 13 weeks shall be equivalent to one quarter, and vice versa; one year shall be equivalent to four quarters, 12 months or 52 weeks, and vice versa; for the conversion of weeks into months, and vice versa, weeks and months shall be converted into days in accordance with the conversion rules for the schemes based on six days in the table in point (b);

(d)

in the case of periods expressed in fractions, those figures shall be converted into the next smaller integer unit applying the rules laid down in points (b) and (c). Fractions of years shall be converted into months unless the scheme involved is based on quarters; if the conversion under this paragraph results in a fraction of a unit, the next higher integer unit shall be taken as the result of the conversion under this paragraph.

(e)

2. The application of paragraph 1 shall not have the effect of producing, for the total sum of the periods completed during one calendar year, a total exceeding the number of days indicated in the last column in the table in point (b) paragraph 1, 52 weeks, 12 months or four quarters. If the periods to be converted correspond to the maximum annual amount of periods under the legislation of the State in which they have been completed, the application of paragraph 1 shall not result within one calendar year in periods that are shorter than the possible maximum annual amount of periods provided under the legislation concerned. 3. The conversion shall be carried out either in one single operation covering all those periods which were communicated as an aggregate, or for each year, if the periods were communicated on a year-by-year basis. 4. Where an institution communicates periods expressed in days, it shall at the same time indicate whether the scheme it administers is based on five days, six days or seven days.

TITLE II: DETERMINATION OF THE LEGISLATION APPLICABLE Article SSCI.13: Details relating to Articles SSC.11 [Detached workers] and SSC.12 [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol 1. For the purposes of the application of point (a) of Article SSC.11(1) [Detached workers], a `person who pursues an activity as an employed person in a State for an employer which normally carries out its activities there and who is sent by that employer to another State' shall include a person who is recruited with a view to being sent to another State, provided that, immediately before the start of that person's employment, the person concerned is already subject to the legislation of the State in which their employer is established. 2. For the purposes of the application of point (a) of Article SSC.11(1) [Detached workers] of the Protocol, the words `which normally carries out its activities there' shall refer to an employer that ordinarily performs substantial activities, other than purely internal management activities, in the territory of the State in which it is established, taking account of all criteria characterising the activities carried out by the undertaking in question. The relevant criteria must be suited to the specific characteristics of each employer and the real nature of the activities carried out. 3. For the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article SSC.11(1) [Detached workers],the words `who normally pursues an activity as a self-employed person' shall refer to a person who habitually carries out substantial activities in the territory of the State in which that person is established. In particular, that person must have already pursued their activity for some time before the date when they wish to take advantage of the provisions of that Article and, during any period of temporary activity in another State, must continue to fulfil, in the State where they are established, the requirements for the pursuit of their activity in order to be able to pursue it on their return. 4. For the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article SSC.11(1) [Detached workers], the criterion for determining whether the activity that a self-employed person goes to pursue in another State is `similar' to the self-employed activity normally pursued shall be that of the actual nature of the activity, rather than of the designation of employed or self-employed activity that may be given to this activity by the other State. 5. For the purposes of the application of Article SSC.12(1) and (5) [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol, a person who `normally pursues an activity as an employed person' in `one or more Member States as well as the United Kingdom', or in `two or more Member States' respectively, shall refer to a person who simultaneously, or in alternation, for the same undertaking or employer or for various undertakings or employers, exercises one or more separate activities in such States. 6. For the purposes of Article SSC.12(1) and (5) [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol, an employed flight crew or cabin crew member normally pursuing air passenger or freight services in two or more States shall be subject to the legislation of the State where the home base, as defined in Article SSC.1 [Definitions] of the Protocol, is located. 7. Marginal activities shall be disregarded for the purposes of determining the applicable legislation under Article SSC.12 [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol. Article SSCI.15 [Procedure for the application of Article SSC.12] of this Annex shall apply to all cases under this Article.

8. For the purposes of the application of Article SSC.12(2) and (6) [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol, a person who `normally pursues an activity as a self-employed person' in `one or more Member States as well as the United Kingdom', or in `two or more Member States respectively', shall refer, in particular, to a person who simultaneously or in alternation pursues one or more separate self- employed activities, irrespective of the nature of those activities, in such States. 9. For the purposes of distinguishing the activities under paragraphs 5 and 8 from the situations described in Article SSC.11(1) [Detached workers] of the Protocol, the duration of the activity in one or more States (whether it is permanent or of an ad hoc or temporary nature) shall be decisive. For these purposes, an overall assessment shall be made of all the relevant facts including, in particular, in the case of an employed person, the place of work as defined in the employment contract. 10. For the purposes of the application of Article SSC.12(1) (2), (5) and (6) [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol, a `substantial part of employed or self-employed activity' pursued in a State shall mean a quantitatively substantial part of all the activities of the employed or selfemployed person pursued there, without this necessarily being the major part of those activities. 11. To determine whether a substantial part of the activities is pursued in a State, the following indicative criteria shall be taken into account: (a) (b) in the case of an employed activity, the working time or the remuneration; and in the case of a self-employed activity, the turnover, working time, number of services rendered or income.

In the framework of an overall assessment, a share of less than 25% in respect of the criteria mentioned above shall be an indicator that a substantial part of the activities is not being pursued in the relevant State. 12. For the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article SSC.12(2) [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol, the `centre of interest' of the activities of a self-employed person shall be determined by taking account of all the aspects of that person's occupational activities, notably the place where the person's fixed and permanent place of business is located, the habitual nature or the duration of the activities pursued, the number of services rendered, and the intention of the person concerned as revealed by all the circumstances. 13. For the determination of the applicable legislation under paragraphs 10, 11 and 12, the institutions concerned shall take into account the situation projected for the following 12 calendar months. 14. If a person pursues his or her activity as an employed person in two or more States on behalf of an employer established outside the territory of the States, and if this person resides in a State without pursuing substantial activity there, they shall be subject to the legislation of the State of residence. Article SSCI.14: Procedures for the application of Article SSC.10(3)(b) and Article SSC.10(4) [General rules] and Article SSC.11 [Detached workers] of the Protocol (on the provision of information to the institutions concerned) 1. Unless otherwise provided for by Article SSCI.15 [Procedure for the application of Article SSC.12] of this Annex, where a person pursues their activity outside the competent State, the employer or, in the case of a person who does not pursue an activity as an employed person, the 1210

person concerned shall inform the competent institution of the State whose legislation is applicable thereof, whenever possible in advance. That institution shall issue the attestation referred to in Article SSCI.16(2) [Provision of information to persons concerned and employers] of this Annex to the person concerned and shall without delay make information concerning the legislation applicable to that person, pursuant to point (b) of Article SSC.10(3) [General rules] or Article SSC.11 [Detached workers] of the Protocol, available to the institution designated by the competent authority of the State in which the activity is pursued. 2. An employer within the meaning of Article SSC.10(4) [General rules] of the Protocol who has an employee on board a vessel flying the flag of another State shall inform the competent institution of the State whose legislation is applicable thereof whenever possible in advance. That institution shall, without delay, make information concerning the legislation applicable to the person concerned, pursuant to Article SSC.10(4) [General rules] of the Protocol, available to the institution designated by the competent authority of the State whose flag, the vessel on which the employee is to perform the activity, is flying. Article SSCI.15: Procedure for the application of Article SSC.12 [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol 1. A person who pursues activities in two or more States, or where Article SSC.12(5) or (6) [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] applies, shall inform the institution designated by the competent authority of the State of residence thereof. 2. The designated institution of the place of residence shall without delay determine the legislation applicable to the person concerned, having regard to Article SSC.12 [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol and Article SSCI.13 [Details relating to Articles SSC.11 [Detached workers] and SSC.12 [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of this Annex. That initial determination shall be provisional. The institution shall inform the designated institutions of each State in which an activity is pursued of its provisional determination. 3. The provisional determination of the applicable legislation, as provided for in paragraph 2, shall become definitive within two months of the institutions designated by the competent authorities of the State(s) concerned being informed of it, in accordance with paragraph 2, unless the legislation has already been definitively determined on the basis of paragraph 4, or at least one of the institutions concerned informs the institution designated by the competent authority of the State of residence by the end of this two-month period that it cannot yet accept the determination or that it takes a different view on this. 4. Where uncertainty about the determination of the applicable legislation requires contacts between the institutions or authorities of two or more States, at the request of one or more of the institutions designated by the competent authorities of the State(s) concerned, or of the competent authorities themselves, the legislation applicable to the person concerned shall be determined by common agreement, having regard to Article SSC.12 [Pursuit of activities in two or more States] of the Protocol and the relevant provisions of Article SSCI.13 [Details relating to Articles SSC.11 [Detached workers] and SSC.12 [Pursuit of activities in two or more States]] of this Annex. Where there is a difference of views between the institutions or competent authorities concerned, those bodies shall seek agreement in accordance with the conditions set out above and Article SSCI.6 [Provisional application of legislation and provisional granting of benefits] of this Annex shall apply.

5. The competent institution of the State whose legislation is determined to be applicable either provisionally or definitively shall without delay inform the person concerned. 6. If the person concerned fails to provide the information referred to in paragraph 1, this Article shall be applied at the initiative of the institution designated by the competent authority of the State of residence as soon as it is appraised of that person's situation, possibly via another institution concerned. Article SSCI.16: Provision of information to persons concerned and employers 1. The competent institution of the State whose legislation becomes applicable pursuant to Title II [Determination of the legislation applicable] of the Protocol shall inform the person concerned and, where appropriate, their employer(s) of the obligations laid down in that legislation. It shall provide them with the necessary assistance to complete the formalities required by that legislation. 2. At the request of the person concerned or of the employer, the competent institution of the State whose legislation is applicable pursuant to Title II [Determination of the legislation applicable] of the Protocol shall provide an attestation that such legislation is applicable and shall indicate, where appropriate, until what date and under what conditions. Article SSCI.17: Cooperation between institutions 1. The relevant institutions shall communicate to the competent institution of the State whose legislation is applicable to a person pursuant to Title II [Determination of the legislation applicable] of the Protocol the necessary information required to establish the date on which that legislation becomes applicable and the contributions which that person and his or her employer(s) are liable to pay under that legislation. 2. The competent institution of the State whose legislation becomes applicable to a person pursuant to Title II [Determination of the legislation applicable] of the Protocol shall make the information indicating the date on which the application of that legislation takes effect available to the institution designated by the competent authority of the State to whose legislation that person was last subject. Article SSCI.18: Cooperation in case of doubts about the validity of issued documents concerning the applicable legislation 1. Where there is doubt about the validity of a document showing the position of the person for the purposes of the applicable legislation or the accuracy of the facts on which the document is based, the institution of the State that receives the document shall ask the issuing institution for the necessary clarification and, where appropriate, the withdrawal or rectification of that document. The requesting institution shall substantiate its request and provide the relevant supporting documentation that gave rise to the request. 2. When receiving such a request, the issuing institution shall reconsider the grounds for issuing the document and, where an error is detected, withdraw it or rectify it within 30 working days from the receipt of the request. The withdrawal or rectification shall have retroactive effect. However, in cases where there is a risk of disproportionate outcome, and in particular, of the loss of status as an insured person for the whole or part of the relevant period in the State(s) concerned, the States shall consider a more proportionate arrangement in such case. When the available evidence permits the issuing institution to find that the applicant of the document has committed fraud, it shall withdraw or rectify the document without delay and with retroactive effect. 1212

TITLE III: SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF BENEFITS CHAPTER 1: SICKNESS, MATERNITY AND EQUIVALENT PATERNITY BENEFITS Article SSCI.19: General implementing provisions 1. The competent authorities or institutions shall ensure that any necessary information is made available to insured persons regarding the procedures and conditions for the granting of benefits in kind where such benefits are received in the territory of a State other than that of the competent institution. 2. Notwithstanding point (a) of Article SSC.6 [Equal treatment of benefits, income, facts or events] of the Protocol, a State may become responsible for the cost of benefits in accordance with Article SSC.20 [Pension claimants] of the Protocol only if, either the insured person has made a claim for a pension under the legislation of that State, or in accordance with Articles SSC.21 [Right to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence] to SSC.27 [Contributions by pensioners] of the Protocol, they receive a pension under the legislation of that State. Article SSCI.20: Regime applicable in the event of the existence of more than one regime in the State of residence or stay If the legislation of the State of residence or stay comprises more than one scheme of sickness, maternity and paternity insurance for more than one category of insured persons, the provisions applicable under Articles SSC.15 [Residence in a State other than the competent State], SSC.17(1) [Stay outside the competent State], SSC.18 [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence], SSC.20 [Pension claimants], SSC.22 [No right to benefits in kind under the legislation of the State of residence] and SSC.24 [Residence of members of the family in a State other than the one in which the pensioner resides] of the Protocol shall be those of the legislation on the general scheme for employed persons.

Reimbursement 4. (a) (b) Where a person or the members of that person's family: have been issued with the document referred to in paragraph 1; have registered that document with the institution of the place of residence in accordance with paragraph 1; and a health fee has been paid by or on behalf of the person or members of their family to the State of residence as part of an application for a permit to enter, stay, work or reside in that State,

(c)

that person or members of that person's family may apply to the institution of the State of residence for reimbursement (in whole or part, as the case may be) of the health fee paid. 4. Where a claim is made in accordance with paragraph 1, the institution of the State of residence shall determine that claim within three calendar months, starting on the day the claim was received, and shall make any reimbursement in accordance with this Article. 5. Where the period of validity of the document referred to in paragraph 1 is less than the period of time in respect of which the health fee has been paid, the amount reimbursed shall not exceed that portion of the health fee which corresponds to the period for which the document had been issued. 6. Where the health fee was paid by another person on behalf of a person to whom this Article applies, reimbursement may be made to that other person. Article SSCI.22: Stay in a State other than the competent State Procedure and scope of right 1. For the purposes of the application of Article SSC.17 [Stay outside the competent State] of the Protocol, the insured person shall present to the health care provider in the State of stay an entitlement document issued by the competent institution indicating his entitlement to benefits in kind. If the insured person does not have such a document, the institution of the place of stay, upon request or if otherwise necessary, shall contact the competent institution in order to obtain one. 2. That document shall indicate that the insured person is entitled to benefits in kind under the conditions laid down in Article SSC.17 [Stay outside the competent State] of the Protocol on the same terms as those applicable to persons insured under the legislation of the State of stay, and shall satisfy the requirements in Appendix SSCI.2. 3. The benefits in kind referred to in Article SSC.17(1) [Stay outside the competent State] of the Protocol shall refer to the benefits in kind which are provided in the State of stay, in accordance with its legislation, and which become necessary on medical grounds with a view to preventing an insured person from being forced to return, before the end of the planned duration of stay, to the competent State to obtain the necessary treatment.

In that case, that institution shall reimburse directly to that person the amount of the costs corresponding to those benefits within the limits of and under the conditions of the reimbursement rates laid down in its legislation. 5. If the reimbursement of such costs has not been requested directly from the institution of the place of stay, the costs incurred shall be reimbursed to the person concerned by the competent institution in accordance with the reimbursement rates administered by the institution of the place of stay or the amounts which would have been subject to reimbursement to the institution of the place of stay, if Article SSCI.47 [Principles] of this Annex had applied in the case concerned. The institution of the place of stay shall provide the competent institution, upon request, with all necessary information about these rates or amounts. 6. By way of derogation from paragraph 5, the competent institution may undertake the reimbursement of the costs incurred within the limits of and under the conditions of the reimbursement rates laid down in its legislation, provided that the insured person has agreed to this provision being applied to them. 7. If the legislation of the State of stay does not provide for reimbursement pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 in the case concerned, the competent institution may reimburse the costs within the limits of and under the conditions of the reimbursement rates laid down in its legislation, without the agreement of the insured person. 8. The reimbursement to the insured person shall not, in any event, exceed the amount of costs actually incurred by them. 9. In the case of substantial expenditure, the competent institution may pay the insured person an appropriate advance as soon as that person submits the application for reimbursement to it. Family Members 10. Paragraphs 1 to 9 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the members of the family of the insured person. Reimbursement for students 11.

(d) a health fee has been paid by or on behalf of that person to the State of study as part of an application for a permit to enter, stay or reside for the purposes of pursuing a full time course of study in that State; that person may apply to the institution of the State of study for reimbursement (in whole or part, as the case may be) of the health fee paid. 12. Where a claim is made in accordance with paragraph 11, the institution of the State of study shall process and settle that claim within a reasonable period but not later than six calendar months starting on the day the claim was received and make any reimbursement in accordance with this Article. 13. Where the period of validity of the entitlement document referred to in point (a) of paragraph 11 is less than the period of time in respect of which the health fee has been paid, the amount of the health fee reimbursed shall be the amount paid which corresponds to the period of validity of that document. 14. Where the health fee was paid by another person on behalf of a person to whom this Article applies, reimbursement may be made to that other person. 15. Paragraphs 11 to 14 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the members of the family of that person.

16. This Article shall enter into force 12 months after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 17. A person who satisfied the conditions in paragraph 11 in the period between the entry into force of this Agreement and the date specified in paragraph 16 may, upon the entry into force of this Article, make a claim for reimbursement under paragraph 11 in relation to that period. 18. By way of derogation from Article SSC.5(1) [Equality of treatment], charges may be imposed by the State of study in accordance with its national law in respect of benefits in kind that do not fulfil the criteria set out in point (a) of Article SSC.17(1) [Stay outside the competent State] and which are provided to a person in respect of whom reimbursement has been made during that person's stay for the period to which that reimbursement relates. Article SSCI.23: Scheduled treatment Authorisation procedure 1. For the purposes of the application of Article SSC.18(1) [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] of the Protocol, the insured person shall present a document issued by the competent institution to the institution of the place of stay. For the purposes of this Article, the competent institution shall mean the institution which bears the cost of the scheduled treatment; in the cases referred to in Article SSC.18(4) [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] and SSC.25(5) [Stay of the pensioner or the members of their family in a State other than the State of residence ­ stay in the competent State ­ authorisation for appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] of the Protocol, in which the benefits in kind provided in the State of residence are reimbursed on the basis of fixed amounts, the competent institution shall mean the institution of the place of residence.

If an insured person does not reside in the competent State, they shall request authorisation from the institution of the place of residence, which shall forward it to the competent institution without delay. In that event, the institution of the place of residence shall certify in a statement whether the conditions set out in the second sentence of Article SSC.18(2) [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] of the Protocol are met in the State of residence. The competent institution may refuse to grant the requested authorisation only if, in accordance with the assessment of the institution of the place of residence, the conditions set out in the second sentence of Article SSC.18(2) [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] of the Protocol are not met in the State of residence of the insured person, or if the same treatment can be provided in the competent State itself, within a time-limit which is medically justifiable, taking into account the current state of health and the probable course of illness of the person concerned. The competent institution shall inform the institution of the place of residence of its decision. In the absence of a reply within the deadlines set by its national legislation, the authorisation shall be considered to have been granted by the competent institution. 3. If an insured person who does not reside in the competent Party is in need of urgent vitally necessary treatment, and the authorisation cannot be refused in accordance with the second sentence of Article SSC.18(2) [Travel with the purpose of receiving benefits in kind ­ authorisation to receive appropriate treatment outside the State of residence] of the Protocol, the authorisation shall be granted by the institution of the place of residence on behalf of the competent institution, which shall be immediately informed by the institution of the place of residence. The competent institution shall accept the findings and the treatment options of the doctors approved by the institution of the place of residence that issues the authorisation, concerning the need for urgent vitally necessary treatment. 4. At any time during the procedure granting the authorisation, the competent institution shall retain the right to have the insured person examined by a doctor of its own choice in the Party of stay or residence. 5. The institution of the place of stay shall, without prejudice to any decision regarding authorisation, inform the competent institution if it appears medically appropriate to supplement the treatment covered by the existing authorisation. Meeting the cost of benefits in kind incurred by the insured person 6. Without prejudice to paragraph 7, Article SSCI.22(4) and (5) [Stay in a State other than the competent State] of this Annex shall apply mutatis mutandis. 7. If the insured person has actually borne all or part of the costs for the authorised medical treatment themselves and the costs which the competent institution is obliged to reimburse to the institution of the place of stay or to the insured person according to paragraph 6 (actual cost) are lower than the costs which it would have had to assume for the same treatment in the competent State (notional cost), the competent institution shall reimburse, upon request, the cost of treatment 1217

incurred by the insured person up to the amount by which the notional cost exceeds the actual cost. The reimbursed sum may not, however, exceed the costs actually incurred by the insured person and may take account of the amount which the insured person would have had to pay if the treatment had been delivered in the competent State. Meeting the costs of travel and stay as part of scheduled treatment 8. Where the national legislation of the competent institution provides for the reimbursement of the costs of travel and stay which are inseparable from the treatment of the insured person, such costs for the person concerned and, if necessary, for a person who must accompany them, shall be assumed by this institution when an authorisation is granted in the case of treatment in another State. Family members 9. Paragraphs 1 to 8 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the members of the family of the insured person. Article SSCI.24: Cash benefits relating to incapacity for work in the event of stay or residence in a State other than the competent State Procedure to be followed by the insured person 1. If the legislation of the competent State requires that the insured person presents a certificate in order to be entitled to cash benefits relating to incapacity for work pursuant to Article SSC.19(1) [Cash benefits] of the Protocol, the insured person shall ask the doctor of the State of residence who established that person's state of health to certify his or her incapacity for work and its probable duration. 2. The insured person shall send the certificate to the competent institution within the time limit laid down by the legislation of the competent State. 3. Where the doctors providing treatment in the State of residence do not issue certificates of incapacity for work, and where such certificates are required under the legislation of the competent State, the person concerned shall apply directly to the institution of the place of residence. That institution shall immediately arrange for a medical assessment of the person's incapacity for work and for the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 to be drawn up. The certificate shall be forwarded to the competent institution forthwith. 4. The forwarding of the document referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not exempt the insured person from fulfilling the obligations provided for by the applicable legislation, in particular with regard to that person's employer. Where appropriate, the employer or the competent institution may call upon the employee to participate in activities designed to promote and assist his or her return to employment. Procedure to be followed by the institution of the State of residence 5. At the request of the competent institution, the institution of the place of residence shall carry out any necessary administrative checks or medical examinations of the person concerned in accordance with the legislation applied by this latter institution. The report of the examining doctor concerning, in particular, the probable duration of the incapacity for work, shall be forwarded without delay by the institution of the place of residence to the competent institution. 1218

Procedure to be followed by the competent institution 6. The competent institution shall reserve the right to have the insured person examined by a doctor of its choice. 7. Without prejudice to the second sentence of Article SSC.19(1) [Cash benefits] of the Protocol, the competent institution shall pay the cash benefits directly to the person concerned and shall, where necessary, inform the institution of the place of residence thereof. 8. For the purposes of the application of Article SSC.19(1) [Cash benefits] of the Protocol, the particulars of the certificate of incapacity for work of an insured person drawn up in another State on the basis of the medical findings of the examining doctor or institution shall have the same legal value as a certificate drawn up in the competent State. 9. If the competent institution refuses the cash benefits, it shall notify its decision to the insured person and at the same time to the institution of the place of residence. Procedure in the event of a stay in a State other than the competent State 10. Paragraphs 1 to 9 shall apply mutatis mutandis when the insured person stays in a State other than the competent State. Article SSCI.25: Contributions by pensioners If a person receives a pension from more than one State, the amount of contributions deducted from all the pensions paid shall, under no circumstances, be greater than the amount deducted in respect of a person who receives the same amount of pension from the competent State. Article SSCI.26: Special implementing measures 1. When a person or a group of persons are exempted upon request from compulsory sickness insurance and such persons are thus not covered by a sickness insurance scheme to which the Protocol applies, the institution of a State shall not, solely because of this exemption, become responsible for bearing the costs of benefits in kind or in cash provided to such persons or to a member of their family under Title III, Chapter I [Sickness, maternity and equivalent paternity benefits], of the Protocol. 2. When the persons referred to in paragraph 1 and the members of their families reside in a State where the right to receive benefits in kind is not subject to conditions of insurance, or of activity as an employed or self-employed person, they shall be liable to pay the full costs of benefits in kind provided in their State of residence. CHAPTER 2: BENEFITS IN RESPECT OF ACCIDENTS AT WORK AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES Article SSCI.27: Right to benefits in kind and in cash in the event of residence or stay in a State other than the competent State 1.

2. When providing special benefits in kind in connection with accidents at work and occupational diseases under the national legislation of the State of stay or residence, the institution of that State shall without delay inform the competent institution. Article SSCI.28: Procedure in the event of an accident at work or occupational disease which occurs in a State other than the competent State 1. If an accident at work occurs or an occupational disease is diagnosed for the first time in a State other than the competent State, the declaration or notification of the accident at work or the occupational disease, where the declaration or notification exists under national legislation, shall be carried out in accordance with the legislation of the competent State, without prejudice, where appropriate, to any other applicable legal provisions in force in the State in which the accident at work occurred or in which the first medical diagnosis of the occupational disease was made, which remain applicable in such cases. The declaration or notification shall be addressed to the competent institution. 2. The institution of the State in the territory of which the accident at work occurred or in which the occupational disease was first diagnosed, shall notify the competent institution of medical certificates drawn up in the territory of that State. 3. Where, as a result of an accident while travelling to or from work which occurs in the territory of a State other than the competent State, an inquiry is necessary in the territory of the first State in order to determine any entitlement to relevant benefits, a person may be appointed for that purpose by the competent institution, which shall inform the authorities of that State. The institutions shall cooperate with each other in order to assess all relevant information and to consult the reports and any other documents relating to the accident. 4. Following treatment, a detailed report accompanied by medical certificates relating to the permanent consequences of the accident or disease, in particular the injured person's present state and the recovery or stabilisation of injuries, shall be sent upon request of the competent institution. The relevant fees shall be paid by the institution of the place of residence or of stay, where appropriate, at the rate applied by that institution to the charge of the competent institution. 5. At the request of the institution of the place of residence or stay, where appropriate, the competent institution shall notify it of the decision setting the date for the recovery or stabilisation of injuries and, where appropriate, the decision concerning the granting of a pension. Article SSCI.29: Disputes concerning the occupational nature of the accident or disease 1. Where the competent institution disputes the application of the legislation relating to accidents at work or occupational diseases under Article SSC.31(2) [Right to benefits in kind and in cash] of the Protocol, it shall without delay inform the institution of the place of residence or stay which provided the benefits in kind, which will then be considered as sickness insurance benefits. 2. When a final decision has been taken on that subject, the competent institution shall, without delay, inform the institution of the place of residence or stay which provided the benefits in kind. Where an accident at work or occupational disease is not established, benefits in kind shall continue to be provided as sickness benefits if the person concerned is entitled to them. Where an accident at work or occupational disease is established, sickness benefits in kind provided to the person concerned shall be considered as accident at work or occupational disease benefits from 1220

The second subparagraph of Article SSCI.6(5) [Provisional application of legislation and provisional granting of benefits] of this Annex shall apply mutatis mutandis. Article SSCI.30: Procedure in the event of exposure to the risk of an occupational disease in two or more States 1. In the case referred to in Article SSC.33 [Benefits for an occupational disease where the person suffering from such a disease has been exposed to the same risk in several States] of the Protocol, the declaration or notification of the occupational disease shall be sent to the competent institution for occupational diseases of the last State under the legislation of which the person concerned pursued an activity likely to cause that disease. When the institution to which the declaration or notification was sent establishes that an activity likely to cause the occupational disease in question was last pursued under the legislation of another State, it shall send the declaration or notification and all accompanying certificates to the equivalent institution in that State. 2. Where the institution of the last State under the legislation of which the person concerned pursued an activity likely to cause the occupational disease in question establishes that the person concerned or his survivors do not meet the requirements of that legislation, inter alia, because the person concerned had never pursued in that State an activity which caused the occupational disease or because that State does not recognise the occupational nature of the disease, that institution shall forward without delay the declaration or notification and all accompanying certificates, including the findings and reports of medical examinations performed by the first institution to the institution of the previous State under the legislation of which the person concerned pursued an activity likely to cause the occupational disease in question. 3. Where appropriate, the institutions shall reiterate the procedure set out in paragraph 2 going back as far as the equivalent institution in the State under whose legislation the person concerned first pursued an activity likely to cause the occupational disease in question. Article SSCI.31: Exchange of information between institutions and advance payments in the event of an appeal against rejection 1. In the event of an appeal against a decision to refuse benefits taken by the institution of a State under the legislation of which the person concerned pursued an activity likely to cause the occupational disease in question, that institution shall inform the institution to which the declaration or notification was sent, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article SSCI.30(2) [Procedure in the event of exposure to the risk of an occupational disease in two or more States] of this Annex, and shall subsequently inform it when a final decision is reached. 2. Where a person is entitled to benefits under the legislation applied by the institution to which the declaration or notification was sent, that institution shall make the advance payments, the amount of which shall be determined, where appropriate, after consulting the institution which made the decision against which the appeal was lodged, and in such a way that overpayments are avoided. The latter institution shall reimburse the advance payments made if, as a result of the appeal, it is obliged to provide those benefits. That amount will then be deducted from the benefits due to the person

The second subparagraph of Article SSCI.6(5) [Provisional application of legislation and provisional granting of benefits] of this Annex shall apply mutatis mutandis. Article SSCI.32: Aggravation of an occupational disease In the cases covered by Article SSC.34 [Aggravation of an occupational disease] of the Protocol, the claimant must provide the institution in the State from which they are claiming entitlement to benefits with details concerning benefits previously granted for the occupational disease in question. That institution may contact any other previously competent institution in order to obtain the information it considers necessary. Article SSCI.33: Assessment of the degree of incapacity in the event of occupational accidents or diseases which occurred previously or subsequently Where a previous or subsequent incapacity for work was caused by an accident which occurred when the person concerned was subject to the legislation of a State which makes no distinction according to the origin of the incapacity to work, the competent institution or the body designated by the competent authority of the State in question shall: (a) upon request by the competent institution of another State, provide information concerning the degree of the previous or subsequent incapacity for work, and where possible, information making it possible to determine whether the incapacity is the result of an accident at work within the meaning of the legislation applied by the institution in the other State; take into account the degree of incapacity caused by these previous or subsequent cases when determining the right to benefits and the amount, in accordance with the applicable legislation.

Article SSCI.34: Submission and investigation of claims for pensions or supplementary allowances In order to receive a pension or supplementary allowance under the legislation of a State, the person concerned or their survivors residing in the territory of another State shall submit, where appropriate, a claim either to the competent institution or to the institution of the place of residence, which shall send it to the competent institution. The claim shall contain the information required under the legislation applied by the competent institution. CHAPTER 3: DEATH GRANTS Article SSCI.35: Claim for death grants For the purposes of applying Articles SSC.37 [Right to grants where death occurs in a State other than the competent one] and SSC.38 [Provision of benefits in the event of the death of a pensioner] of the Protocol, the claim for death grants shall be sent either to the competent institution or to the institution of the claimant's place of residence, which shall send it to the competent institution.

CHAPTER 4: INVALIDITY BENEFITS AND OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS' PENSIONS Article SSCI.36: Additional provisions for the calculation of the benefit 1. For the purposes of calculating the theoretical amount and the actual amount of the benefit in accordance with Article SSC.47(1)(b) [Award of benefits] of the Protocol, the rules provided for in Article SSCI.11(3), (4), (5) and (6) [Aggregation of periods] of the Annex shall apply. 2. Where periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance have not been taken into account under Article SSC.11(3)[Aggregation of periods] of this Annex , the institution of the State under whose legislation those periods were completed shall calculate the amount corresponding to those periods under the legislation it applies. The actual amount of the benefit, calculated in accordance with Article SSC.47(1)(b) [Award of benefits] of the Protocol, shall be increased by the amount corresponding to periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance. 3. The institution of each State shall calculate, under the legislation it applies, the amount due corresponding to periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance which, under Article SSC.48(3)(c) [Rules to prevent overlapping] of the Protocol, shall not be subject to the another State's rules relating to withdrawal, reduction or suspension. Where the legislation applied by the competent institution does not allow it to determine this amount directly, on the grounds that that legislation allocates different values to insurance periods, a notional amount may be established. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall lay down the detailed arrangements for the determination of that notional amount. Article SSCI.37: Claims for benefits A. Submission of claims for old-age and survivors' pensions 1. The claimant shall submit a claim to the institution of his place of residence or to the institution of the last State whose legislation was applicable. If the person concerned was not, at any time, subject to the legislation applied by the institution of the place of residence, that institution shall forward the claim to the institution of the last State whose legislation was applicable. 2. The date of submission of the claim shall apply in all the institutions concerned.

3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, if the claimant does not, despite having been asked to do so, notify the fact that he or she has been employed or has resided in other States, the date on which the claimant completes his or her initial claim or submits a new claim for his or her missing periods of employment or/and residence in a State shall be considered as the date of submission of the claim to the institution applying the legislation in question, subject to more favourable provisions of that legislation. Article SSCI.38: Certificates and information to be submitted with the claim by the claimant 1. The claim shall be submitted by the claimant in accordance with the provisions of the legislation applied by the institution referred to in Article SSCI.37(1) [Claims for benefits] of this Annex, and be accompanied by the supporting documents required by that legislation. In particular, the claimant shall supply all available relevant information and supporting documents relating to periods of insurance (institutions, identification numbers), employment (employers) or self-employment (nature and place of activity) and residence (addresses) which may have been completed under other legislation, as well as the length of those periods. 1223

2. Where, in accordance with Article SSC.45(1) [General Provisions] of the Protocol, the claimant requests deferment of the award of old-age benefits under the legislation of one or more States, the claimant shall state that in their claim and specify under which legislation the deferment is requested. In order to enable the claimant to exercise that right, the institutions concerned shall, upon the request of the claimant, notify them of all the information available to them so that he or she can assess the consequences of concurrent or successive awards of benefits which they might claim. 3. Should the claimant withdraw a claim for benefits provided for under the legislation of a particular State, that withdrawal shall not be considered as a concurrent withdrawal of claims for benefits under the legislation of another State. Article SSCI.39: Investigation of claims by the institutions concerned Contact institution 1. The institution to which the claim for benefits is submitted or forwarded in accordance with Article SSCI.37(1) [Claims for benefits] of this Annex to the Protocol shall be referred to hereinafter as the `contact institution'. The institution of the place of residence shall not be referred to as the contact institution if the person concerned has not, at any time, been subject to the legislation which that institution applies. In addition to investigating the claim for benefits under the legislation which it applies, this institution shall, in its capacity as contact institution, promote the exchange of data, the communication of decisions and the operations necessary for the investigation of the claim by the institutions concerned, and supply the claimant, upon request, with any information relevant to the aspects of the investigation which arise under the Protocol, and keep the claimant informed of its progress. Investigation of claims for old-age and survivors pensions 2. The contact institution shall, without delay, send claims for benefits and all the documents which it has available and, where appropriate, the relevant documents supplied by the claimant to all the institutions in question so that they can all start the investigation of the claim concurrently. The contact institution shall notify the other institutions of periods of insurance or residence subject to its legislation. It shall also indicate which documents shall be submitted at a later date and supplement the claim as soon as possible. 3. Each of the institutions in question shall notify the contact institution and the other institutions in question, as soon as possible, of the periods of insurance or residence subject to their legislation. 4. Each of the institutions in question shall calculate the amount of benefits in accordance with Article SSC.47 [Award of benefits] of the Protocol and shall notify the contact institution and the other institutions concerned of its decision, of the amount of benefits due and of any information required for the purposes of Articles SSC.48 [Rules to prevent overlapping] to SSC.50 [Overlapping of benefits of a different kind] of the Protocol. 5. Should an institution establish, on the basis of the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, that Article SSC.52(2) or (3) [Periods of insurance or residence of less than one year] of the Protocol is applicable, it shall inform the contact institution and the other institutions concerned.

Article SSCI.40: Notification of decisions to the claimant 1. Each institution shall notify the claimant of the decision it has taken in accordance with the applicable legislation. Each decision shall specify the remedies and periods allowed for appeals. Once the contact institution has been notified of all decisions taken by each institution, it shall send the claimant and the other institutions concerned a summary of those decisions. A model summary shall be drawn up by the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination. The summary shall be sent to the claimant in the language of the institution or, at the request of the claimant, in any language of their choice, including English, recognised as an official language of the Union. 2. Where it appears to the claimant following receipt of the summary that his or her rights may have been adversely affected by the interaction of decisions taken by two or more institutions, the claimant shall have the right to a review of the decisions by the institutions concerned within the time limits laid down in the respective national legislation. The time limits shall commence on the date of receipt of the summary. The claimant shall be notified of the result of the review in writing. Article SSCI.41: Determination of the degree of invalidity Each institution shall, in accordance with its legislation, have the possibility of having the claimant examined by a medical doctor or other expert of its choice to determine the degree of invalidity. However, the institution of a State shall take into consideration documents, medical reports and administrative information collected by the institution of any other State as if they had been drawn up in its own territory. Article SSCI.42: Provisional instalments and advance payment of a benefit 1. Notwithstanding Article SSCI.7 [Provisional calculation of benefits and contributions] of this Annex, any institution which establishes, while investigating a claim for benefits, that the claimant is entitled to an independent benefit under the applicable legislation, in accordance with point (a) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits], shall pay that benefit without delay. That payment shall be considered provisional if the amount might be affected by the result of the claim investigation procedure. 2. Whenever it is evident from the information available that the claimant is entitled to a payment from an institution under point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits] of the Protocol, that institution shall make an advance payment, the amount of which shall be as close as possible to the amount which will probably be paid under point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) [Award of benefits] of the Protocol. 3. Each institution which is obliged to pay the provisional benefits or advance payment under paragraphs 1 or 2 shall inform the claimant without delay, specifically drawing the claimant's attention to the provisional nature of the measure and any rights of appeal in accordance with its legislation. Article SSCI.43: New calculation of benefits 1. Where there is a new calculation of benefits in accordance with Article SSC.45(4) [General provisions] and 54(1) [Recalculation and revaluation of benefits] of the Protocol, Article SSCI.42 [Provisional instalments and advance payment of a benefit] of this Annex shall be applicable mutatis mutandis.

2. Where there is a new calculation, withdrawal or suspension of the benefit, the institution which took the decision shall inform the person concerned without delay and shall inform each of the institutions in respect of which the person concerned has an entitlement. Article SSCI.44: Measures intended to accelerate the pension calculation process 1. In order to facilitate and accelerate the investigation of claims and the payment of benefits, the institutions to whose legislation a person has been subject shall: (a) exchange with or make available to institutions of other States the elements for identifying persons who change from one applicable national legislation to another, and together ensure that those identification elements are retained and correspond, or, failing that, provide those persons with the means to access their identification elements directly; sufficiently in advance of the minimum age for commencing pension rights or before an age to be determined by national legislation, exchange with or make available to the person concerned and to institutions of other States information (periods completed or other important elements) on the pension entitlements of persons who have changed from one applicable legislation to another or, failing that, inform those persons of, or provide them with, the means of familiarising themselves with their prospective benefit entitlement.

(b)

2. For the purposes of applying paragraph 1, the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall determine the elements of information to be exchanged or made available and shall establish the appropriate procedures and mechanisms, taking account of the characteristics, administrative and technical organisation, and the technological means at the disposal of national pension schemes. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall ensure the implementation of those pension schemes by organising a follow-up to the measures taken and their application. 3. For the purposes of applying paragraph 1, the institution in the first State where a person is allocated a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for the purposes of social security administration should be provided with the information referred to in this Article. Article SSCI.45: Coordination measures in the States 1. Without prejudice to Article SSC.46 [Special provisions on aggregation of periods] of the Protocol, where national legislation includes rules for determining the institution responsible or the scheme applicable or for designating periods of insurance to a specific scheme, those rules shall be applied, taking into account only periods of insurance completed under the legislation of the State concerned. 2. Where national legislation includes rules for the coordination of special schemes for civil servants and the general scheme for employed persons, those rules shall not be affected by the provisions of the Protocol and of this Annex. CHAPTER 5: UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Article SSCI.46: Aggregation of periods and calculation of benefits 1. Article SSCI.11(1) [Aggregation of periods] of this Annex shall apply mutatis mutandis to Article SSC.56 [Special provisions on aggregation of periods of insurance, employment or self-employment] of the Protocol.

person concerned may submit to the competent institution a document issued by the institution of the State to whose legislation they were subject in respect of that person's last activity as an employed or self-employed person specifying the periods completed under that legislation. 2. For the purposes of applying Article SSC.57 [Calculation of unemployment benefits] of the Protocol, the competent institution of a State whose legislation provides that the calculation of benefits varies with the number of members of the family shall also take into account the members of the family of the person concerned residing in another State as if they resided in the competent State. This provision shall not apply where, in the State of residence of members of the family, another person is entitled to unemployment benefits calculated on the basis of the number of members of the family. TITLE IV: FINANCIAL PROVISIONS CHAPTER 1: REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COST OF BENEFITS IN APPLICATION OF ARTICLE SSC.30 [Reimbursements between institutions] AND ARTICLE SSC.36 [Reimbursements between institutions] OF THE PROTOCOL Section 1: Reimbursement on the basis of actual expenditure Article SSCI.47: Principles 1. For the purposes of applying Article SSC.30 [Reimbursements between institutions] and Article SSC.36 [Reimbursements between institutions] of the Protocol, the actual amount of the expenses for benefits in kind, as shown in the accounts of the institution that provided them, shall be reimbursed to that institution by the competent institution, except where Article SSCI.57 [Provisionally paid benefits in cash or contributions] of this Annex is applicable. 2. If any or part of the actual amount of the expenses for benefits referred to in paragraph 1 is not shown in the accounts of the institution that provided them, the amount to be refunded shall be determined on the basis of a lump-sum payment calculated from all the appropriate references obtained from the data available. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall assess the bases to be used for calculation of the lump-sum payment and shall decide the amount thereof. 3. Higher rates than those applicable to the benefits in kind provided to insured persons subject to the legislation applied by the institution providing the benefits referred to in paragraph 1 may not be taken into account in the reimbursement. Section 2: Reimbursement on the basis of fixed amounts Article SSCI.48: Identification of the State(s) concerned 1. The States referred to in Article SSC.30(2) [Reimbursements between institutions] of the Protocol, whose legal or administrative structures are such that the use of reimbursement on the basis of actual expenditure is not appropriate, are listed in Appendix SSCI-3 to this Annex. 2. In the case of the States listed in Appendix SSCI-3 to this Annex, the amount of benefits in kind supplied to: (a) family members who do not reside in the same State as the insured person, as provided for in Article SSC.15 [Residence in a State other than the competent State] of the Protocol; and to 1227

shall be reimbursed by the competent institutions to the institutions providing those benefits, on the basis of a fixed amount established for each calendar year. This fixed amount shall be as close as possible to actual expenditure. Article SSCI.49: Calculation method of the monthly fixed amounts and the total fixed amount 1. For each creditor State, the monthly fixed amount per person (Fi) for a calendar year shall be determined by dividing the annual average cost per person (Yi), broken down by age group (i), by 12 and by applying a reduction (X) to the result in accordance with the following formula: Fi = Yi*1/12*(1-X) Where: the index (i = 1, 2 and 3) represents the three age groups used for calculating the fixed amounts: i = 1: persons aged under 20, i = 2: persons aged from 20 to 64, i = 3: persons aged 65 and over, Yi represents the annual average cost per person in age group i, as defined in paragraph 2, the coefficient X (0.20 or 0.15) represents the reduction as defined in paragraph 3.

2. The annual average cost per person (Yi) in age group i shall be obtained by dividing the annual expenditure on all benefits in kind provided by the institutions of the creditor State to all persons in the age group concerned subject to its legislation and residing within its territory by the average number of persons concerned in that age group in the calendar year in question. The calculation shall be based on the expenditure under the schemes referred to in Article SSCI.20 [Regime applicable in the event of the existence of more than one regime in the State of residence or stay] of this Annex. 3. The reduction to be applied to the monthly fixed amount shall, in principle, be equal to 20% (X = 0.20). It shall be equal to 15% (X = 0.15) for pensioners and members of their family where the competent State is not listed in Annex SSC-3 [More rights for pensioners returning to the competent State]. 4. For each debtor State, the total fixed amount for a calendar year shall be the sum of the products obtained by multiplying, in each age group i, the determined monthly fixed amounts per person by the number of months completed by the persons concerned in the creditor State in that age group. 1228

The number of months completed by the persons concerned in the creditor State shall be the sum of the calendar months in a calendar year during which the persons concerned were, because of their residence in the territory of the creditor State, eligible to receive benefits in kind in that territory at the expense of the debtor State. Those months shall be determined from an inventory kept for that purpose by the institution of the place of residence, based on documentary evidence of the entitlement of the beneficiaries supplied by the competent institution. 5. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination may present a proposal containing any amendments which may prove necessary in order to ensure that the calculation of fixed amounts comes as close as possible to the actual expenditure incurred and the reductions referred to in paragraph 3 do not result in unbalanced payments or double payments for the States. 6. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall establish the methods for determining the elements for calculating the fixed amounts referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5. Article SSCI.50: Notification of annual average costs The annual average cost per person in each age group for a specific year shall be notified to the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination at the latest by the end of the second year following the year in question. If the notification is not made by this deadline, the annual average cost per person which the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination has last determined for a previous year will be taken. Section 3 : Common provisions Article SSCI.51 : Procedure for reimbursement between institutions 1. The reimbursements between the States shall be made as promptly as possible. Every institution concerned shall be obliged to reimburse claims before the deadlines mentioned in this Section, as soon as it is in a position to do so. A dispute concerning a particular claim shall not hinder the reimbursement of another claim or other claims. 2. The reimbursements between the institutions of the Member States and the United Kingdom, provided for in Articles SSC.30 [Reimbursements between institutions] and SSC.36 [Reimbursements between institutions] of the Protocol, shall be made via the liaison body. There may be a separate liaison body for reimbursements under Article SSC.30 [Reimbursements between institutions] and Article SSC.36 [Reimbursements between institutions] of the Protocol. Article SSCI.52: Deadlines for the introduction and settlement of claims 1. Claims based on actual expenditure shall be introduced to the liaison body of the debtor State within 12 months of the end of the calendar half-year during which those claims were recorded in the accounts of the creditor institution. 2. Claims of fixed amounts for a calendar year shall be introduced to the liaison body of the debtor State within the 12-month period following the month during which the average costs for the year concerned were approved by the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination. The inventories referred to Article SSCI.49(4) [Calculation method of the monthly fixed amounts and the total fixed amount]of this Annex shall be presented by the end of the year following the reference year.

3. In the case referred to in the second subparagraph of Article SSCI.7(5) [Provisional calculation of benefits and contributions] of this Annex, the deadline set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not start before the competent institution has been identified. 4. Claims introduced after the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be considered.

5. The claims shall be paid to the liaison body of the creditor State referred to in Article SSCI.51 [Procedure for reimbursement between institutions] of this Annex, by the debtor institution within 18 months of the end of the month during which they were introduced to the liaison body of the debtor State. This does not apply to the claims which the debtor institution has rejected for a relevant reason within that period. 6. Any disputes concerning a claim shall be settled, at the latest, within 36 months following the month in which the claim was introduced. 7. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall facilitate the final closing of accounts in cases where a settlement cannot be reached within the period set out in paragraph 6, and, upon a reasoned request by one of the parties in the dispute, shall give its opinion on a dispute within six months following the month in which the matter was referred to it. Article SSCI.53: Interest on late payments and down payments 1. From the end of the 18-month period set out in Article SSCI.52(5) [Deadlines for the introduction and settlement of claims] of this Annex, interest can be charged by the creditor institution on outstanding claims, unless the debtor institution has made, within six months of the end of the month during which the claim was introduced, a down payment of at least 90% of the total claim introduced pursuant to Article SSCI.52(1) or (2) [Deadlines for the introduction and settlement of claims] of this Annex. For those parts of the claim not covered by the down payment, interest may be charged only from the end of the 36-month period set out in Article SSCI.53(6) of this Annex. 2. The interest shall be calculated on the basis of the reference rate applied by the financial institution designated for this purpose by the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination to its main refinancing operations. The reference rate applicable shall be that in force on the first day of the month on which the payment is due. 3. No liaison body shall be obliged to accept a down payment as provided for in paragraph 1. If however, a liaison body declines such an offer, the creditor institution shall no longer be entitled to charge interest on late payments related to the claims in question other than under the second sentence of paragraph 1. Article SSCI.54: Statement of Annual Accounts 1. The Partnership Council shall establish the claims situation for each calendar year on the basis of the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination's report. To this end, the liaison bodies shall notify the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination, by the deadlines and according to the procedures laid down by the latter, of the amount of the claims introduced, settled or contested (creditor position) and the amount of claims received, settled or contested (debtor position). 2. The Partnership Council may perform any appropriate checks on the statistical and accounting data used as the basis for drawing up the annual statement of claims provided for in paragraph 1 in order, in particular, to ensure that they comply with the rules laid down under this Title. 1230

CHAPTER 2: RECOVERY OF BENEFITS PROVIDED BUT NOT DUE, RECOVERY OF PROVISIONAL PAYMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS, OFFSETTING AND ASSISTANCE WITH RECOVERY Section 1 : Principles Article SSCI.55 : Common provisions For the purposes of applying Article SSC.64 [Collection of contributions and recovery of benefits] of the Protocol and within the framework defined therein, the recovery of claims shall, wherever possible, be by way of offsetting either between the institutions of the Member State concerned and of the United Kingdom, or vis-à-vis the natural or legal person concerned in accordance with Articles SSCI.56 [Benefits received unduly] to SSCI.58 [Costs relating to offsetting] of this Annex. If it is not possible to recover all or any of the claim via this offsetting procedure, the remainder of the amount due shall be recovered in accordance with Articles SSCI.59 [Definitions and common provisions] to SSCI.69 [Costs related to recovery] of this Annex. Section 2: Offsetting Article SSCI.56: Benefits received unduly 1. If the institution of a State has paid undue benefits to a person, that institution may, within the terms and limits laid down in the legislation it applies, request the institution of the State responsible for paying benefits to the person concerned to deduct the undue amount from arrears or on-going payments owed to the person concerned regardless of the social security branch under which the benefit is paid. The institution of the latter State shall deduct the amount concerned subject to the conditions and limits applying to this kind of offsetting procedure in accordance with the legislation it applies in the same way as if it had made the overpayments itself, and shall transfer the amount deducted to the institution that has paid undue benefits. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, if, when awarding or reviewing benefits in respect of invalidity benefits, old-age and survivors' pensions pursuant to Chapter 3 [Death grants] and 4 [Invalidity benefits] of Title III [Special provisions concerning the various categories of benefits] of the Protocol, the institution of a State has paid to a person benefits of undue sum, that institution may request the institution of the State responsible for the payment of corresponding benefits to the person concerned to deduct the amount overpaid from the arrears payable to the person concerned. After the latter institution has informed the institution that has paid an undue sum of these arrears, the institution which has paid the undue sum shall within two months communicate the amount of the undue sum. If the institution which is due to pay arrears receives that communication within the deadline it shall transfer the amount deducted to the institution which has paid undue sums. If the deadline expires, that institution shall without delay pay out the arrears to the person concerned. 3. If a person has received social welfare assistance in one State during a period in which they were entitled to benefits under the legislation of another State, the body which provided the assistance may, if it is legally entitled to reclaim the benefits due to the person concerned, request the institution of any other State responsible for paying benefits in favour of the person concerned to deduct the amount of assistance paid from the amounts which that State pays to the person concerned. This provision shall apply mutatis mutandis to any family member of a person concerned who has received assistance in the territory of a State during a period in which the insured person was entitled to benefits under the legislation of another State in respect of that family member. 1231

The institution of a State which has paid an undue amount of assistance shall send a statement of the amount due to the institution of the other State, which shall then deduct the amount, subject to the conditions and limits laid down for this kind of offsetting procedure in accordance with the legislation it applies, and transfer the amount without delay to the institution that has paid the undue amount. Article SSCI.57: Provisionally paid benefits in cash or contributions 1. For the purposes of applying Article SSCI.6 [Provisional application of legislation and provisional granting of benefits] of this Annex, at the latest three months after the applicable legislation has been determined or the institution responsible for paying the benefits has been identified, the institution which provisionally paid the cash benefits shall draw up a statement of the amount provisionally paid and shall send it to the institution identified as being competent. The institution identified as being competent for paying the benefits shall deduct the amount due in respect of the provisional payment from the arrears of the corresponding benefits it owes to the person concerned and shall without delay transfer the amount deducted to the institution which provisionally paid the cash benefits. If the amount of provisionally paid benefits exceeds the amount of arrears, or if arrears do not exist, the institution identified as being competent shall deduct this amount from ongoing payments subject to the conditions and limits applying to this kind of offsetting procedure under the legislation it applies, and without delay transfer the amount deducted to the institution which provisionally paid the cash benefits. 2. The institution which has provisionally received contributions from a legal or natural person shall not reimburse the amounts in question to the person who paid them until it has ascertained from the institution identified as being competent the sums due to it under Article SSCI.6(4) [Provisional application of legislation and provisional granting of benefits] of this Annex. Upon request of the institution identified as being competent, which shall be made at the latest three months after the applicable legislation has been determined, the institution that has provisionally received contributions shall transfer them to the institution identified as being competent for that period for the purpose of settling the situation concerning the contributions owed by the legal or natural person to it. The contributions transferred shall be retroactively deemed as having been paid to the institution identified as being competent. If the amount of provisionally paid contributions exceeds the amount the legal or natural person owes to the institution identified as being competent, the institution which provisionally received contributions shall reimburse the amount in excess to the legal or natural person concerned. Article SSCI.58: Costs related to offsetting No costs are payable where the debt is recovered via the offsetting procedure provided for in Articles SSCI.56 [Benefits received unduly] and SSCI.57 [Provisionally paid benefits in cash or contributions] of this Annex.

The applicant party shall forward to the requested party any relevant information relating to the matter which gave rise to the request for recovery, as soon as this comes to its knowledge. Article SSCI.63: Instrument permitting enforcement of recovery 1. In accordance with Article SSC.64(2) [Collection of contributions and recovery of benefits] of the Protocol, the instrument permitting enforcement of the claim shall be directly recognised and treated automatically as an instrument permitting the enforcement of a claim of the State of the requested party 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the instrument permitting enforcement of the claim may, where appropriate and in accordance with the provisions in force in the State of the requested party, be accepted as, recognised as, supplemented with, or replaced by an instrument authorising enforcement in the territory of that State. Within three months of the date of receipt of the request for recovery, the State(s) shall endeavour to complete the acceptance, recognition, supplementing or replacement, except in cases where the third subparagraph of this paragraph applies. States may not refuse to complete these actions where the instrument permitting enforcement is properly drawn up. The requested party shall inform the applicant party of the grounds for exceeding the three-month period.

Article SSCI.64: Payment arrangements and deadline 1. Claims shall be recovered in the currency of the State of the requested party.

3. From the date on which the instrument permitting enforcement of the recovery of the claim has been directly recognised in accordance with Article SSCI.63(1) [Instrument permitting enforcement of recovery] of this Annex, or accepted, recognised, supplemented or replaced in accordance with Article SSCI.63(2) [Instrument permitting enforcement of recovery] of this Annex to the Protocol, interest shall be charged for late payment under the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in force in the State of the requested party and shall also be remitted to the applicant party. Article SSCI.65: Contestation concerning the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement of its recovery and contestation concerning enforcement measures 1. If, in the course of the recovery procedure, the claim or the instrument permitting its enforcement issued in the State of the applicant party are contested by an interested party, the action shall be brought by this party before the appropriate authorities of the State of the applicant party, in accordance with the laws in force in that State. The applicant party shall without delay notify the requested party of this action. The interested party may also inform the requested party of the action. 2. As soon as the requested party has received the notification or information referred to in paragraph 1 either from the applicant party or from the interested party, it shall suspend the enforcement procedure pending the decision of the appropriate authority in the matter, unless the applicant party requests otherwise in accordance with the second subparagraph of this paragraph. Should the requested party deem it necessary, and without prejudice to Article SSCI.68 [Precautionary measures] of this Annex, it may take precautionary measures to guarantee recovery insofar as the laws or regulations in force in its own State allow such action for similar claims. Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, the applicant party may, in accordance with the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in its own State, request the requested party to recover a contested claim, insofar as the relevant laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in the requested party's State allow such action. If the result of the contestation is subsequently favourable to the debtor, the applicant party shall be liable for the reimbursement of any sums recovered, together with any compensation due, in accordance with the legislation in force in the requested party's State. 3. Where the contestation concerns enforcement measures taken in the State of the requested party, the action shall be brought before the appropriate authority of that State in accordance with its laws and regulations. 4. Where the appropriate authority before which the action is brought in accordance with paragraph 1 is a judicial or administrative tribunal, the decision of that tribunal, insofar as it is favourable to the applicant party and permits recovery of the claim in the State of the applicant party, shall constitute the `instrument permitting enforcement' within the meaning of Articles SSCI.62 [Request for recovery] and SSCI.63 [Instrument permitting enforcement of recovery] of the Annex and the recovery of the claim shall proceed on the basis of that decision. Article SSCI.66: Limits applying to assistance 1. (a) The requested party shall not be obliged: to grant the assistance provided for in Articles SSCI.62 [Request for recovery] to SSCI.65 [Contestation concerning the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement of its recovery and contestation concerning enforcement measures] of this Annex, if recovery of the claim would, because of the situation of the debtor, create serious economic or social difficulties in 1236

the State of the requested party, insofar as the laws, regulations or administrative practices in force in the State of the requested party allow such action for similar national claims; (b) to grant the assistance provided for in Articles SSCI.60 [Request for information] to SSCI.65 [Contestation concerning the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement of its recovery and contestation concerning enforcement measures] of this Annex, if the initial request under Articles SSCI.60 [Request for information] to SSCI.62 [Request for recovery] of this Annex applies to claims more than five years old, dating from the moment the instrument permitting the recovery was established in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative practices in force in the State of the applicant party at the date of the request. However, if the claim or instrument is contested, the time limit begins from the moment that the State of the applicant party establishes that the claim or the enforcement order permitting recovery may no longer be contested.

2. The requested party shall inform the applicant party of the grounds for refusing a request for assistance. Article SSCI.67: Periods of limitation 1. (a) Questions concerning periods of limitation shall be governed as follows: by the laws in force in the State of the applicant party, insofar as they concern the claim or the instrument permitting its enforcement; and by the laws in force in the State of the requested party, insofar as they concern enforcement measures in the requested State.

(b)

Periods of limitation according to the laws in force in the State of the requested party shall start from the date of direct recognition or from the date of acceptance, recognition, supplementing or replacement in accordance with Article SSCI.63 [Instrument permitting enforcement of recovery] of this Annex. 2. Steps taken in the recovery of claims by the requested party in pursuance of a request for assistance, which, if they had been carried out by the applicant party, would have had the effect of suspending or interrupting the period of limitation according to the laws in force in the State of the applicant party, shall be deemed to have been taken in the latter, insofar as that effect is concerned. Article SSCI.68: Precautionary measures Upon reasoned request by the applicant party, the requested party shall take precautionary measures to ensure recovery of a claim insofar as the laws and regulations in force in the State of the requested party so permit. For the purposes of implementing the first paragraph, the provisions and procedures laid down in Articles SSCI.62 [Request for recovery], SSCI.63 [Instrument permitting enforcement of recovery], SSCI.65 [Contestation concerning the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement of its recovery and contestation concerning enforcement measures] and SSCI.66 [Limits applying to assistance] of this Annex shall apply mutatis mutandis.

Article SSCI.69: Costs related to recovery 1. The requested party shall recover from the natural or legal person concerned and retain any costs linked to recovery which it incurs, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the State of the requested party that apply to similar claims. 2. Mutual assistance afforded under this Section shall, as a rule, be free of charge. However, where recovery poses a specific problem or concerns a very large amount in costs, the applicant and the requested parties may agree on reimbursement arrangements specific to the cases in question. The State of the applicant party shall remain liable to the State of the requested party for any costs and any losses incurred as a result of actions held to be unfounded, as far as either the substance of the claim or the validity of the instrument issued by the applicant party is concerned.

TITLE V: MISCELLANEOUS, TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS Article SSCI.70: Medical examination and administrative checks 1. Without prejudice to other provisions, where a recipient or a claimant of benefits, or a member of that person's family, is staying or residing within the territory of a State other than that in which the debtor institution is located, the medical examination shall be carried out, at the request of that institution, by the institution of the beneficiary's place of stay or residence in accordance with the procedures laid down by the legislation applied by that institution. The debtor institution shall inform the institution of the place of stay or residence of any special requirements, if necessary, to be followed and points to be covered by the medical examination. 2. The institution of the place of stay or residence shall forward a report to the debtor institution that requested the medical examination. This institution shall be bound by the findings of the institution of the place of stay or residence. The debtor institution shall reserve the right to have the beneficiary examined by a doctor of its choice. However, the beneficiary may be asked to return to the State of the debtor institution only if that beneficiary is able to make the journey without prejudice to that person's health and the cost of travel and accommodation is paid for by the debtor institution. 3. Where a recipient or a claimant of benefits, or a member of that person's family, is staying or residing in the territory of a State other than that in which the debtor institution is located, the administrative check shall, at the request of the debtor institution, be performed by the institution of the beneficiary's place of stay or residence. Paragraph 2 shall also apply in this case. 4. As an exception to the principle of free-of-charge mutual administrative cooperation in Article SSC.59(3) [Cooperation] of the Protocol, the effective amount of the expenses of the checks referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be refunded to the institution which was requested to carry them out by the debtor institution which requested them.
